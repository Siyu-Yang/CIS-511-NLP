Viterbi algorithm tag prediction accuracy = 88.36%

Simple baseline accuracy = 86.31%

Analyze the 3 errors :

1)
'LASHED' was predicted as NP rather than the truth of VBD.
Reason and fix : 'LASHED' only appears in train data not in test data. Thus, the prob of this word is 1/|V| after smoothing. We can fix that by enlarging the train dataset, or change another smoothing method.

2)
'on' was predicted as IN rather than the truth of RP.
Reason and fix: Pr(IN/VBD) = 0.124 and Pr(RP/VBD) = 0.0095 so it is more likely to classify it into IN. We can fix that by  using bigram to take 'vote on' as a whole.

3)
'most' was predicted as JJS rather than the truth of RBS.
Reason and fix: P(JJS/JJ) = 0.109 and P(RBS/JJ) = 0.0001 so it is more likely to classify it into JJS. We can fix that by  using bigram to take 'most powerful' as a whole.
