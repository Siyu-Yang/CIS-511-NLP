Thanks Tracey and Christian. Tree Tops Retreat is a hidden gem of the northern beaches. We had a wonderful time and throughly enjoyed our weekend. The accommodation was fantastic and your hospitality was great! I would recommend Tree Tops to everyone. Thanks again.

This lovely studio is in one of the most beautiful parts of the whole world! We spent a week here in winter in perfect conditions - extraordinary walks and wonderful food all close. A fabulous cafe within 5 minutes walk and a further stroll down the road leads you to spectacular cliffs. We will definitely return...
********** po

Tree Tops Retreat is absolutely beautiful. We stayed here on a gorgeous public holiday weekend and the apartment was the perfect base for trips to the many stunning beaches in the vicinity. The apartment is fully equiped for any type of stay, with DVD's, books, a BBQ etc and Tracey was very helpful. I would recommend Tree Tops to anybody!
********** po

The property was great value for money, and Tracey is a very attentive & thoughtful host
********** po

Tracey was a great host! Everything was very clear and well organised. The self contained studio is private, modern, and clean. We were visiting Palm Beach for a friends wedding. We loved the location, waking up to the birds, and the wonderful windows looking out to the trees. We highly recommend Tree Tops Retreat and we'd love to come back! Thank you for having us Tracey.

Brian and Crystal gave me the pleasure of using 'A little bit of Sydney' to stay for a night and shoot a short film. Even though I felt like I invaded their house they treated my like family. Once we started talking we couldn't stop. One of the nicest people I have ever met! Brian and Crystal were wonderful hosts and the accommodation was awesome! 
********** po

Brian and Crystal were delightful hosts. They welcomed us like old friends into their beautiful home. They provided us with as much information as we wanted for getting around and finding what we wanted as well as making excellent suggestions of what to visit nearby. (Do not miss the wildlife park in Blacktown it is the best I have ever seen) Finally, they accompanied us to downtown Sydney when we discovered they wanted to visit the market that day. All in all a great experience.
********** po

Brian was away but Crystal looked after us very well. The room is comfy and the bathroom next door was HUGE with lovely fluffy towels and shampoo etc if you forgot your own.! Everything is very pristine and neat and we were made to feel very welcome from the moment we arrived it felt like home. Tea and coffee is available at anytime to help yourself which was much appreciated. Thanks again Crystal for the interesting talk over toast!!!
********** po

I stayed with 5 friends in Brians house over New Years eve. We had a really good time. Brian found for every probleme a solutions and Crystel was very polite to us.
********** po

We were Brian's and Crystal's guests. Brian and Crystal were wonderful hosts: they dedicate themselves to us being very caring and helpful. They spent much time with us and we had very interesting conversations with them, so that time went by very quickly. The house was very cosy, comfortable and clean. We felt at home and will keep our stay with them in good memory.
Thank you very much.
********** po

We extended our stay as we liked it so much!

Brian n Crystal were epic :) they were very kind , lovely n make sure we had a good happy stay with them They gave us a warm welcome , offered us a lovely nice dinner ! Brian gives makes sure I wld be able to get back n forth to his place n given me a lift in the morning ! Their place is cozy , clean ( spotless ) , nice coffee !! we had great conversation with them though out our stay ! I'm very glad to stay in his place :) Ps . His place is very clean :) Thx:) 
********** po

We stayed at Brian/Crystal's home for 4 nights. Brian and Crystal are wonderful hosts. They are great people to meet, to talk and to be friends with. They also took care of us during our stay with local guidance and assistance. The house is super clean and neat. We feel lucky that we chose to stay at Brian's home as opposed to CBD hotels. A 5+ stars experience. I would recommend Brian/Crystal as Sydney hosts to anyone. 
********** po

We had travelled over 2,500 kms by the time we reached our final destination......Brian and Crystal's house in Sydney. We were NOT disappointed. Their house has the size, splendor and sparkle of a palace but the warmth and comfort of your favorite holiday home! It was immaculate, spacious and tastefully decorated. We had a large double room and the kids shared a room with a futon each and a television...this set up suited our teenagers perfectly. We had our own private bathroom and access to a further shower if needs we needed it! Crystal was away when we arrived however she frequently gave us great advise or answered our questions over the phone. Brian was very welcoming and helped us to plan two wonderful days in Sydney. It was also lovely to sit and chat with him over a beer or glass of wine in the evening. He is clever,fascinating humerus and thought provoking person and we enjoyed his company very much. Crystal was also wonderful but unfortunately we met her only briefly the night before we left. We regret not spending more time with this lovely, lady, who despite her busy business trip to Melbourne took the time to help us make our trip to sydney awesome. We loved the city (Website hidden by Airbnb) was magical. I think it must be one of the most beautiful cities in the world. The high powered boat ride was exhilirating, our meal infront of the opera house delicious and the views from the bridge and the cable car going up to the zoo were incredible!! On Crystals recommendation we bought all our presents in Paddy's market..that was so much fun and a great experience. We ate fresh fish on the harbor and ate ice cream by the ton. Once Brian had advised us how to get around with the train and the ferry it was easy peasy and NOT at all expensive...Sunday was a particularly reasonable day to travel. Staying with Brian was the perfect way to conclude a wonderful holiday and we would thoroughly recommend a stayiwith Brian and Crystal to anyone..the kids loved it too .....a telly in every room and an endless supply of DVD's!
********** po

Brain and Crystal are excellent host!!! My family and I enjoyed a good stay with them. They know well about Melbourne which helps me a lot when visted there. Their house is spacious and clean. They are very kind & considerate , they almost repared everything for us! Looking forward to meet them soon since we have our second stay in their house as well.
********** po

Place is nice. It is traditional British Style house. Not very big but comfort. Simple furnished but clean. The house is 10-15mins to Newtown station and 18mins to novena station. Both station have shopping mall n restaurant. It is good to prepare the daily necessities as it might not have much in the house. Elizabeth was on her way to travel when I came so we didn't meet n it caused some communication problems. Apart from that everything went fine.
********** po

I enjoyed my stay here. This is an old colonial British house, and it was a unique experience to stay there. But do not expect it to be like a new condo. Elizabeth is friendly and she was very helpful. She made sure that I arrived and that I was able to find the place. The place is close to the Newton MRT, shopping centers, bus stops, and the popular Newton food court center.
********** po

We truly recommended the room. The room is very clean and location is really convenient :)
********** po

It was great staying with Elizabeth. She is a warm and friendly person, always ready to help. The place is cozy, neat and clean with all the required amenities. The kitchen is big with many utensils and she allows you to cook. The bath is sharing but convenient and clean. I could also got my laundry done twice in a stay of 10 days and also she made me try all the food she made which was certainly very nice of her. She takes care of every need of the guests. Also if you are going to reside in Singapore, she gives you really good tips on where to buy things from, a free add on ;) This place has a great location making everything nearby. The Newton MRT Station and Newton Food Centre are at the walking distance where you can find every kind of food (Indian as well). All this made my stay very comfortable.
********** po

Elizabeth was amazingly considerate. Loved staying at her place.
********** po

Happy is a great, accommodating and helpful host. The condo was very clean and equipped with a pool and gym and close to the mrt. Everything was convienent. I recommend Happy and her cozy place for a stay in Singapore.
********** po

Apartment was very clean and neat. Private bathroom was excellent, and the condo is beautiful with a great pool. Internet worked well (30/5). Happy was very helpful and accommodating. She showed me how to get around the city and helped me find a print shop. Transportation is good. The subway was a bit of a walk (10+ mins), but there were nearby buses that come very often and take you straight to the Expo and the airport. (Expo bus is #12. Airport bus is #24, but (Hidden by Airbnb) Maps won't show the correct route to the bus stop... you'll have to ask Happy). Lots of cheap food by the subway station, but nothing that's closer.
********** po

Happy is very friendly and answered fast to our messages. She explained us were we can find restaurants and brought us to the bus stop the next morning. The pool is nice and big enough for swimming. Room and breakfast were okay.
********** po

Happy was a very great host i would definally recommend her place.
********** po

Happy was a great host! We spend only one night there, but though she personally showed us the shopping and food market which is just 10min walk away from her home! Getting there from the airport with the taxi was realy easy and cheep! Accomodation had everything we needed+extra big and nice condom pool which was realy great to have due to very hot and humid climate! We think about staying there again! Thanks Happy! Maybe till next year!
********** po

Happy is very kind and she was welcoming us on Saturday noon. I was late and she waited for us to come. However, Last minute I had to changed plan to stay only 1 night cause my parents preferred to stay in central area. She helped us to change our booking. After that we regretted, as Happy's place is better than hotel's room my parents stayed. Definitely will choose to stay in Happy's place again in the future, as it is cheaper and the room is much more better than hotel's room. The room also has private bathroom with shower and bathtub. You can find place to eat by walking around 5-10 minutes from Happy's place. Thank you Happy.
********** po

The place is chill. The host is nice. Worth coming over again.
********** po

Thank you very much. You are very nice. Fantastic place, large and quiet. great location, near airport and MRT.
********** po

Easy to access public transport. Quite and beautiful ambient around.
********** po

Happy's place is very spacious and clean with living room, kitchen and laundry area. Free access to gym and huge swimming pool. Place is highly secured because you'll have to use an access card to go in and out of Changi Rise Condo. They have nice landscapes and fish pond. Near to bus stop and 10mins walk to nearest MRT and Mall. Highly Recommended!
********** po

My stay in rio was my first stay via air bnb. And dalia is the best hostess that a traveler can expect. She is adorable, available, very helpful and so nice. I like her very much.my husband and i really enjoyed the place. The flat is as described in the ad, that s a simple and very practical apartment offering a great view on copacabana beach. It is very well located. 
********** po

The studio is set up according to description, very comfortable and well located close to beach and supermarkets. dalia is a very good host and was always available for questions.
********** po

Dalia is a very nice person, she will host you with a real pleasure, I trust ! She welcomes and take the time to explain how to find yourself in Rio. The flat is really well located, only 30sec walking from Copacabana beach, and 10min from Ipanema wich is the place for nice restaurants. I really recommend this flat in Rio !
********** po

Me and my GF spend in total 8 days in Dalia's appartment. She is a great host! Friendly, open, en will help you whenever needed! The appartment is small and clean, the location and building is safe and is perfect to visit both copacabana and ipanema beach. Nice shops, restaurant and bakery's around as well.
********** po

Dalia's lovely apartment is perfectly located near Arpoador and Ipanema and beautifully appointed. Perfect for 1 or 2 people, it has a lateral view of the Copacabana and is a half-block to a jump in the water. As a bonus, all the building staff are friendly and helpful. And Dalia herself is a wonder - I'm only sad I didn't get to know her better during my stay. After a long flight from NY, the snacks she left for her guest were so welcoming and a sweet touch She has put obvious care into the apartment and is a resource for anyone who might need help navigating around Rio. The cozy apt. comes with a small kitchen for basic needs (coffee, etc.), a comfy bed, TV, wi-fi, A/C, a warm shower, and has nice homey touches. Other reviewers mentioned noise from the street but I found no problem with that at all. And the neighborhood has every necessity, including a delicious veg-focused por kilo on the building's first floor.  I definitely would recommend this apt for anyone's stay in Rio.
********** po

It s was a great appartment with a perfect location (50 m of copacabana and 5 min walk ipanema ) the place to be in Rio Thanks Andrea
********** po

Our stay in Andrea's place was all well located between Copacobana and Ipanema Beach. This apartment was clean, furnished cute and simple, and located in the middle of the two beaches, posto 6 one block from the Copa Beach, and 4 blocks to the Ipanema Beach. Walking distance to metro, buses, shops, restaurants, grocery, laundry, etc. I loved the location so much that I will go back and stay at her place months at a time.
********** po

Good location, pleasant and helpful landlady, luxury, much noise from the street, you need earplugs.
********** nt

It is extremely well located, one block from Copacabana beach and very convenient. The appartment is really nice and everything works perfectly. There is a doorman 24 hours and the hostest is great, she was very helpful and gave us some good tips. The only thing we didn´t like was that is very noisy, you could hear everything that was going on at the street. 
********** nt

We had a great stay in this apartment. It was really spacious and clean and in a great area between Copacabana and Ipanema beaches. There was some annoying maintenance going on in the room above us which was quite noisy but this was not the hosts fault. Overall i would definately recommend this apartment.
********** nt

Very helpful and friendly host, The apartment is nicely renovated and the location is great!
********** po

Great place to stay! Excellent location in between 2 beaches. Exactly as the pictures. Highly recommand to anyone who is going to Rio for holiday.
********** po

We stayed 5 nights here and we found the apartment was very well located between the 2 beaches. The host Andrea was very helpful and came round straight away when we needed something. We had to get something repaired while we were there and this was done immediately with a minimum of fuss. i would definitely recommend this apartment.
********** po

Great location, one block from Copacabana and 5 min walking from Ipanema. Quite loud though, as the sleeping room is right at a major street.
********** nt

I stayed in this one bedroom apartment in January 2012 . It is clean within walking distance to Copacabana & Ipanema Beaches in Rio .The security is good with a 24/7 doorman in the lobby of the building .The adjacent streets are very noisy with the traffic .The windows of this apartment are not sound proof so I was not able to sleep without earplugs ! Also there is no air conditioner in the apartment , only ceiling fans are available in each room . To find a parking space near the apartment is also a challenge .

Doug is a fantastic host, very friendly and approachable. Great knowledge of the area and very helpful. The room was really clean and the bed super comfortable. The shower was excellent too! We really enjoyed our stay in LA with Doug's place being our first stop. Great way to start our holiday and we would definitely come back. Thanks Doug! 
********** po

Everything about the stay here was fantastic. Doug was a fast communicator and responded quickly to my questions. There is no access to the rest of the house from this room, so when I asked about accessing a fridge, Doug brought out a mini fridge from the shed to let me use. The room and bathroom were very clean, and the snacks were a nice touch. Towels, soap, shampoo, mouthwash, and even toothbrushes were provided. Recommended!
********** po

Doug place was perfect for us. Quiet, convenient. Great small pool and a relaxing time. Doug was genuine and fun to chat with. We'll will be back when we are in the area. It's a quiet little gem! 
********** po

Best stay ever. Great place, quite, clean, comfortable and a very friendly host. If you search a stay in Los Angeles, go to Doug.

We had a awsome time in the super clean and cosy place from Doug. He is super friendly and help full. ASllways will come back.

This is an amazing location. Close to everything

We spent two nights at Katja’s place. Great location for Universal studio ! The home is very clean and you have everything that you need to enjoy your stay. Even the breakfast was included!! The decoration is awesome, a real feeling of LA!
********** po

I like the ambience. Super cool! Katja is very nice host. Love it!
********** po

Expect a beautiful place, class, comfort, and character. A+++!
********** po

This was my first time using Airbnb and because of Katja it was amazing. Her space was spotless, cute, comfy, and conveniently located! The check in process was so easy and fast! I was actually really sad to leave after our weekend was up! 
I definitely have plans to come back and stay with Katja!
********** po

You will luv this studio! Really cool, inspiring, and peaceful in the Hollywood hills, close to the Boulavard, Melrose, and Universal. The owners are friendly and made us feel comfortable immediately. The music floating through the windows was really special. Katja is a beauty, inside & out! 
********** po

Katja and Ralph are great hosts. The communication with them was perfect. Their place has a very nice charm to it because it is filled with memorabilia from their professional career. The neighborhood is very quit and safe.
********** po

Perfect location if you’re wanting to visit Universal Studios. You can walk there but we opted for a Lyft. The streets are very narrow so be careful driving and walking! Katja was an awesome host and very helpful with directions and advise.
********** po

Awesome stay! My company and I enjoy our stay and will definitely book again! Katja and her brother were very helpful with any questions we had.
********** po

This is such a great oasis from the bustle of LA. Perfect location near Universal Studios where I was going to mecca to the Harry Potter Wizarding world. Just a quick 10 minute walk and there was a fab 8:30am yoga studio, next door green juice/ hot breakfast/Starbucks. Amazing Persian restaurant had fab lunch. $6-7 5min Uber to park. Classic Hollywood charm in the hills, with gorgeous gardens. Hearing Katja jam out to her sax made the backdrop all that more inviting. The space had a perfect master bedroom with a nook where loud snorers could do their thing without disturbing bedroom below! Plenty of towels. And what a rock star house with guitars/records everywhere. Fun set up. Definitely feel part of the LA vibe. Would stay again!

We chose Cryn's listing because of the wonderful reviews, and we soon realized what everyone was talking about. We loved staying with Cryn for so many reasons -- the bed was comfortable, the home was cozy, the neighborhood so calm yet lively -- it is packed with inexpensive South Asian fare, and a Bollywood cinema nearby! Cryn provided us with fresh towels, homemade bread and jams, wild berries from the garden, suggestions for fun things to do (she can draw a mean map!), and warm breakfast conversation. It was our first time in London and it turned out we picked the perfect spot. We initially thought about venturing out to other parts of England but decided we were too comfortable to leave, we happily extended our stay.
********** po

Cryn was an exceptional host. I was in London on business for two weeks and I could not have picked a better spot to stay. Cryn's home is clean and full of character. The garden was a great spot to unwind after work. Her home is very close to the District Line as well as the Hammersmith & City Line. While I was there Cryn shared her home baked bread and scones with me. She was a great help in finding my way around the city. I am a runner and she showed me a great running route along the Greenway to the 2012 Olympic Park. I really can't say enough nice things about Cryn and her wonderful home. I would not hesitate to stay there again. 
********** po

We had a warm welcome in Cryns cosy and quiet house. Cryn was very hospitable, had very helpful suggestions for our days in London and helped us plan our trip in every way.
********** po

it was my second time staying in Cryns house, a peaceful, restful house, and Cryn making home made bread for you and an ever ready cup of tea in her charming garden was the exact escape I needed after a busy day in London. I can say with certainty that you wont find a nicer host. See you next time Cryn.
********** po

My stay began in June, 2012 and was a most enjoyable one. My host from day one made me feel at home. I had complete access to house..kitchen, yoga room, living/tv room and yard for sunning or just relaxing. The atmosphere at this house is a very calming and easy going lifestyle. I enjoyed my stay immensly and plan to return. At first the neighbourhood was intimidating with the many one way streets and terrace houses that all look the same and I found the tube station more than a 5 minute walk. But with time, I noticed it was actually very (Website hidden by Airbnb) was on the same street that was handy for grocery shopping/post office/restaurants. There was also the bus stop that my host graciously took me on a tour the first day of my arrival which was also very accessible and I used more. Cryn was always available to help with directions, suggestions and whatever help was asked. I could not have asked for a better host.She is indeed a wealth of knowledge on any topic, a great conversationalist, entertainer and I enjoyed our numerous outings.
********** po

It was my first experience with AirBnB and it was great. I think I will never stay a t a hotel anymore. Michael is a really nice and helpful host and the apartment is nice. The location is perfect. Maybe I come back soon.
********** po

We only stayed 1 night at Mike's, who is a very friendly and helpful host. The appartment is located close to transportation and quite central. The guest room is well equipped and with a comfy bed. For the price, I would say it is a good deal and I would try to go there again if I had to stay in London.
********** po

Mike was very responsive and helpful. The location is very good and the room is clean. A nice experience in all.
********** po

Mike was a charming easy going host. The room was clean, with a very comfortable bed. Mike allowed us use of his kitchen and space to put our food. He also provided some breakfast munchies food as well as coffee and tea. Since we were blogging out trip, Mike had written clearly how to connect to his wifi with no problems. The place is in a great area, between two different stops, Russell Square (the closer of the two, also near the British Museum) and a major stop, Kings Cross. A very walkable area and easy to find things like grocery stores and bars. I recommend going to Pret A Manger across from Russell Square for quick grab and go food. 
********** po

Michael was a very friendly and hospitable host. We felt very welcome and he was working at home so we could always get help. His flat is located in central london. We never had a long way home and you can walk to every part of London in less than 1 hour. The room is very comfy and bright and the bed is perfect. One star minus because the kitchen and the bathroom could have been cleaner. However we had a great stay. Thanks Michael
********** po

Mike's flat was exactly as pictured. The room was more than big enough for the two of us. The location was great, and Mike had clean sheets, towels, hairdryer, some breakfast food and WiFi readily available. Mike himself was very friendly and gave us plenty of tips. Would stay there again!
********** po

Michael is a very nice person. He did everything possible to make my stay very pleasant. The flat was clean and organized. I fully recommend him.
********** po

Thank you Michael for a very comfortable night in London. He lives very close to the St. Pancras Eurostar station. He is also easily accessible by underground to Heathrow but we botched that a bit. Nice and comfortable and a good value. We also appreciate the help with the sightseeing. Thanks again.
********** po

Michael is a great host. He provided us with useful information about the city. We really thank his hospitality. Do not hesitate to stay at his place. A very convenient location.
********** po

100% satisfied, and Michael was fun to talk to. Great location, clean room, ample travel info and maps, everything I needed. I spent half my time working from the room and he was totally cool with it, made my mostly business-related trip smooth, painless, and even fun. 
********** po

Great location, spacious apartment, clean / modern decoration, you can't go wrong. I highly recommend

The apartment is spacious and clean, very well equiped, well located. Definitely recommend. We got a slightly different apt than the one in the photos (in the same building) with a smaller bedroom but it was not a problem for us, overall was great.

Excellent Apartment, very well managed and 24x7 Service. Highly recommended for Short term to Long term Stay. Cevdet is an excellent host.
********** po

We had a full weekend in this residence. An excellent flat with a great location in Nisantasi in a very secure street, just a few steps to the best cafes, restaurants and shops. There is a market next door, and 2 cafes in front of the residence. The flat is very well equipped with anything you need in the kitchen to cook like you are at home. The linens and towels are very clean as well as the flat itself. Very bright and peaceful atmosphere; although it is a few steps to the main street, there isn't much noice. The staff are very helpful. Free wifi, tea and coffee and bath amenities are all a plus as well as the dishwasher and the washing machine (so you don't need a laundery no matter how long you stay here). Highly recommended for couples and families.

Guliz is a great host and I really enjoyed my stay at her apartment for my first time in Istanbul. She has a deep cultural knowledge of Turkey and gave me a lot of useful tips for discovering Istanbul. In addition, the apartment is neat and cosy, and ideally located, walking distance from Taksim and Istiklal street. 
********** po

I really enjoyed my week staying with Guliz. Her apartment and the room are very comfortable - you have everything you need and in a great location (you can walk more or less everywhere or the tram is nearby if you don't feel like walking). Guliz is a warm and welcoming host and happy to help with whatever you need and to share her home with you. She is knowledgeable about Istanbul and can recommend places to go and some delicious places to eat dinner. We spent a lot of time talking and exchanging experiences and although she was busy working for a deadline, still made time to eat dinner and have a drink together. A great host and a great place!
********** po

I really enoyed staying at Guliz's apartment. The location is great since it is in a nice neighbourhood with many little shops and restaurants. It is in walking distance to Taksim Square and Istiklal Caddesi, Tophane tram station is also just a walk down the hill. I felt very safe even when walking home late at night. The room itself and the apartment are very nice and I felt very comfortable. Guliz was a very friendly and helpful host and I enjoyed her company. I would always come back to stay at her place!
********** po

Guliz was very kind and warm host and her place was awesome. Her title says all. Super recommended.********** po
I really enjoyed my stay in Istanbul at Guliz's apartment. Guliz is a wonderful host -- incredibly generous with guidance about the city, and equally helpful as I coordinated my arrival and departure. Her apartment is lovely, the guest room clean and cozy, and the location PERFECT. Highly recommended!
********** po

A very clean, very nice room in a very clean, very nice apartment, well located in Cihangir near Taksim and Istiklal. Güliz answered quickly by mail and gave clear indications before arrival. I totally recommend her place for your stay in Istanbul. Thank you Güliz !
********** po

I strongly recommend Guliz as a host. She is kind as well as independent and has a profound knowledge of Istanbul which she generously shares with her guests. Her room is as described in the advertisment: central, cozy, clean - and quiet. You find nice little restaurants and food shopping facilities in the neighbourhood. Due to the proximity to Taksim square access to public transport and to Istikhlal Rd. is easy. Don't hesitate to make a request for rental. I would, if I came to Istanbul again. 
********** po

Guliz has been a great host, very cozy. The house was nice and always very clean and in a very nice area of Istanbul to hang out at night. 
********** po

Guliz is a great host! Thanks for having me and for sure will stay again!

Guliz is a super host. Her place is perfectly located for exploring Istanbul. Close to nice breakfast restaurants and the quiet part of Cihangir area. A clean and confortable place to retreat to after busy days in exotic istanbul.

Nicola's place is a great unique place located at a very special lively, old neighbourhood. The apartment is tastefully restored with an admirable effort to preserve the original. I loved the personal touches and the original details; the beautiful glass and iron work, the high ceiling, concrete kitchen counter, original fire-brick wall, original bath and sink etc... Nicola is an excellent host, she always answered our messages instantly ; when we had the slightest problem , she made sure that it was solved right away. We loved to stay in that apartment at a special time for us, we spent the first days of our honey- moon here. Thanks Nicola, we love you. Ps. We love our neighbour too!
********** po

First the location was great, close to restaurants and cafes, was able to walk to everywhere around the area. Communication was efficient and easy with Nicola, she even let us check in way early due to my early flight and sent a nice lady to show us around. I would definitely stay here again and enjoy this unique and cozy place.
********** po

This place is great! Perfect location, really cute design, and a beautifully classic BA building.
********** po

We stayed at Nicola's flat for a week in October. The flat is lovely, airy, calm and well equipped. Its location makes it very convenient to visit San Telmo, the ecological reserve of Puerto Maduro or the shopping district on foot, and other areas of Buenos Aires can be reached by bus or subte. The flat is well equipped, and has plenty of little homey touches. Being able to do some laundry was also very convenient. The main problem during our stay was that there was no wi-fi for the whole duration. We never managed to solve the problem and lost quite a lot of time trying to figure out alternatives. Despite this, we had very good communication with our host, who did all she could do from a distance. Also, Nicola's wonderful neighbour and friend Jenny opened her wifi to us to partly mitigate the issue, and she was also a mine of information and good spirits.
********** nt

If you get the opportunity to book this place, snap it up! What a gem! It's in a perfect location, right in an interesting and fun part of town! The flat is on the top floor of a building, which makes it a surprisingly quiet location considering you're in the center of BA. The flat itself is beautiful, with wood, tiles and stain glass windows creating a lovely environment to be in. It comes equipped with anything you might need! Nicola is a wonderful host and very quick in responding to emails. She is also very generous with her knowledge and made our transition from the UK to South America very easy. If we have the opportunity in the future to come back to Buenos Aires we will certainly be staying here!
********** po

Angela was the perfect host as far as we are concerned. Caring and flexible as we managed to slip on the check out date. Full of good advice as to what to do and not to while in BA. If traveling by staying in rented apartments I have no hesitation in recomending Angela as a host and the San Telmo loft as the place to stay.
********** po

I can recommend staying with Angela to new visitors to BA as she'll give you all the information you need to get to know your way around the city, and San Telmo is a great place to start. AND I can recommend staying with Angela to the more season BA-visitor too as she'll assist you in getting even more out of your stay. A great hostess, a great place to base yourself in BA, something for everyone - what more can I say? We'll be back!

Probably one of the nicest experiences we've had in South America: staying at Angela's loft. Highly recommended, a host that goes the extra mile and then some to make all her guests feel at home right-away. We can't recommend it highly enough! Thanks Angela: we'll be back before you know it!
********** po

Angela was a lovely host. She made us feel very welcome and gave us lots of hints and ideas for our 3 night stay with her in Buenos Aires. The loft, where we stayed was clean and in a good position. She provided us with a cell phone to contact her in case we needed help and there was also free wi-fi. We loved getting to know Angela and are looking forward to our return visit in a few weeks. We would definitely recommend staying with her on your next visit to Buenos Aires Judy and Roma from Australia
********** po

The loft is conveniently located and is genuinely cool. We loved the beautiful vintage fridge (working), brass sink and other great antiques in the loft. Everything is kept very clean (and working) and the place really feels like home when you are there. We had a great time and Angela was wonderful. The cell phone she provided for us was very helpful and allowed us to contact restaurants/shops etc (easy to add credit at any kiosk). The free wi-fi was also very helpful for making last minute plans on my iphone. Don't miss the mate in the kitchen, which you should really try (you generally won't find this available at coffee shops for some reason). Angela was very helpful and gave us great advice/recommendations. Definitely read her blog before you visit, as it will answer many of your questions and also give you some good ideas (we enjoyed the wine tasting): (Website hidden by Airbnb) Thanks Angela!
********** po

We had a wonderful time in Buenos Aires, with Angela a big part of that experience. The location was excellent and access to other areas was easy. Angela made herself available, and we honestly connected with her immediately. She greeted us, gave us great pointers and we genuinely enjoyed her company. If we get the chance to return to Argentina, we will look her up.  But we certainly expect to keep in touch in any case, hopefully in New Orleans, or even Phila. It was the best part of our trip around South America. 
********** po

The loft was great, the neighborhood is great, and Angela is super friendly and helpful! I only wish we could have stayed longer. If you're looking for a great BA experience, stay in the loft!
********** po

Angela is amazing! We came in very late, and she was still so helpful and accommodating, making sure that we had access to any information and tips that we needed. Throughout our stay, Angela made herself available for questions and help navigating obstacles such as canceled flights. The loft itself was very clean, comfortable, and uncompromisingly cool.Would definitely stay with her again.
********** po

The loft is fantastic and quirky all in one but Angela truly made our experience. She woke up at 1AM to let us in after our flight got in. She had a list of things to do within the San Telmo along with tea and a couple beers in the fridge. She was so accomodating and went above and beyond her obligation to make sure that our stay was pretty perfect. I would highly recommend this place!
********** po

Great space! Well decorated, super clean, interesting neighborhood. Highly recommended!

The flat is very nice. Perfect location in a nice area of Kreuzberg, 3 min walking from metro station. I did not meet Matthias, but he was very prompt and accurate in answering to my email. The people who gove me the key was very nice. The flat was clean and complete in furniture and all necessary to cook. Reccomended!!
********** po

The flat was very nice, perfectly located. It was a real pleasure to stay there. The perfect nest for vacation :) Thank you Max and Friedrich!
********** po

Max is a well organized, very nice host, who left perfect instructions. The appartment is all it promises: cozy, best location, fully equipped! I felt right at home and will definatly make it my Berlin home again!
********** po

The flat was beautiful and very comfy. Located in on of the best Berlin district, it was a pleasure to stay there.
********** po

nice and cosy studio. great location with many services.

Two friends and I stayed in this lovely apartment when we came to Berlin to run the Berlin Marathon. We loved the apartment and the location. It was clear that nobody lives in this apartment by a few little things that could be better. For example, there is no place to put your soap or shampoo in the shower (except the floor) and there is no dresser in the master bedroom - little things that did not really affect our stay but made it clear that this is a rental apartment. When we arrived at the airport and called the contact person to ask for assistance in taking public transit to the apartment the man could not tell us what subway stop to use. I think his exact words were Don't you have a map?. We did but were tired from a long night of travel so we took a cab. Turns out the public transit system is excellent (as we expected it to be) and is very convenient to the apartment and we used it for our entire stay without problem. The apartment itself is bright and airy with tall ceilings. We LOVED it. We loved that it was close to Mauer park, a nice grocery store and loads of great restaurants, shops and merchants. We would recommend this apartment to anyone and would stay there again if we ever come back. We LOVED Berlin. What a vibrant, interesting and dynamic city! 
********** po

Great apartment, much bigger than the photos. Cool location, highly recommended, book it now.
********** po

Nice and spacious apartment in an interesting location.
********** po

Very nice place, comfortable. Neighbourhood very exciting. Cleanliness ok, dust coming in from construction not their fault.. Kitchen needed some additions like frying pen for example. Logistics with key, check in and check out worked fine. When we moved in a neighbour shouted at us it is not legal to sublet etc. We suggest the host ans AirBnB make sure things like that don't happen .
********** nt

Be aware that the host does not live in Berlin and has a service manage the apartment. We were told by the host prior to booking that we could check in in the morning, which is why we selected this apartment, but then the manager/housekeeper refused to meet us with the key before the afternoon. (one key only, by the way...) Only one bed was made up; we had to wait 4 hours to receive sheets for the other bed. When I asked for an extra sheet because it was chilly, I was told that I paid only for one sheet. A light fixture fell from the wall and neither the host nor the housekeeper responded to numerous messages and emails seeking help in clearing away the shards of glass to avoid injury. The apartment itself is fine and bright, but the service was such that I would not recommend booking this unit.
********** ng

Nice stay in family at nice place And well located! I would recomend it.
********** po

The host had a property manager bring by the key. The listing description was accurate and the neighborhood is very upscale.
********** po

Marc's apartment was as it looks in the images with added blinds in both bedrooms. The first bedroom had a double bed and was nicely lit by sunlight and the second had a single bed and a foldable bunk bed if needed. All kitchen items we needed were around. Cleanliness isn't the apartments best suit but it didn't ruin our stay. We had to just clean-up a bit when we got in and that wasn't so nice. As for location, the place is so nicely located and in a beautiful neighborhood. We found many cafes and awesome restaurants around and within walking distance! Both the team that runs the apartment and Marc were very responsive in case we had any questions or concerns about the apartment amenities. Marc even gave us a refund back since the wifi wasn't working throughout our stay and the important thing is that he was so gracious about it. Overall the stay was a nice experience.
********** po

Fabulous location! Looks just like in the pictures, and there is a great bathroom not in the picture as well. Easy check in process and communication. Such a great stay, so many cute places in walking distance! It was just 2 girls and we felt totally safe walking around at all times day and night, to/from the metro, etc. 
********** po

Fabulous flat, even bigger than the pictures suggest and in a great location. Lots of light, it's very cool, comfortable and surprisingly child friendly (there is a high chair and a cot and the minimalist aesthetics of the flat means there is not much to break! there's also a ridiculous amount of great playgrounds within walking distance...). It is good to know that you need to go up and down two flights of stairs to access the lift. The neighbourhood being so great there can be some street noise at night but it's very quiet with the windows closed. Comms with Mark were super easy. I would very much recommend staying there - it makes for a perfect base to explore the city or just hang out.

My family and I stayed at Betty's Flat for our first stop on a month long trip to China. As this was our first time using Airbnb outside of the US, we were a bit hesitant at first, but Betty's excellent communication before and during your arrival reassured our confidence in our stay. The cab driver had no trouble finding the flat with the directions Betty gave us beforehand and even if we took a subway, it's located only a 5-10 minute walk from 2 different subway stations. The flat is very centrally located, spacious, well laid out, and very new and modern. It definitely felt like a home away from home and served as a better option than any hotel. Everything was thoughtfully laid out for guests. It was the perfect accommodations to come home to after a long day of sightseeing and dodging the November cold of Beijing. The location was absolutely perfect. Only a 5-10 minute walk to 2 different subway stations and plenty of great eating establishments near and around the flat! We've been in 3 other cities since Betty's flat and we cannot stop raving about it! It has by far been our best accommodations in China. 
********** po

If you are looking for a comfortable, convenient and all around great place in Beijing then this is where you want to stay. The pictures on airbnb’s website are exactly what you will see when you enter this apartment. We arrived in December when the temperature had suddenly dipped and coming into this apartment there was no shortage of heat! This apartment was a very short walk to the subway station and from there the city is was ours to discover. Not only are the major tourist sites a short way away, both by subway or walking, but the surrounding area is quiet with plenty of places to eat. For those who prefer to cook there is a wonderful vegetable seller just around the corner and plenty of small convenience stores. Betty is outstanding and is always a phone call or email away and her pre-arrival package helped our taxi driver get us to the apartment from the airport easily. She responded to all of our emails and bent over backwards to help us. She even called us when we had arrived to make sure everything was okay and to see if we had settled in okay. The wonderful Chinese couple that takes care of the place were also very generous and helpful. Summer, winter, spring or fall, if you are going to stay in Beijing then this is the only place to stay.
********** po

What a great experience! I don't know what to be happier about, the quiet, comfortable, clean apartment; or Betty's willingness or rather eagerness to help us have a wonderful time in Beijing. My family and I stayed in Betty's apartment for a week in the cold of January. The apartment was very well kept and surprisingly cozy and warm. If you've not traveled much in China, you will learn that counting heaters in the winter, or AC in the summer is a good idea before you book. Each day of our trip it was so wonderful to walk back off the main streets into the little neighborhood and into the cozy quiet warm apartment. If we return to Beijing, this will be my first choice on places to stay. 
********** po

We had an excellent stay at Betty's Beijing apartment. We were 4 young professionals on vacation & this apartment was perfect for our needs. It is clean and has everything you need (towels,etc.). It is a short walk to Wangfujing & the Forbidden city, and a short cab ride to the SanLiTun bars. We visited in February & were happy that this apartment stays warm with great heating :) The coolest part about this apartment is the small lane it is located on. It is a modern apartment on a very cool old-Beijing looking lane. There are great local restaurants, a dumpling place 1 block away, and even a Jian Bing stand some mornings (try it!). Betty was incredibly helpful & even put us in contact with a driver for our Great Wall excursion. Highly Recommend. Thanks Betty! 
********** po

Betty's apartment is just superb. It is in one of the most central locations in Beijing and within walking distance to Beijing's Wangfujing shopping district with plenty of restaurants and a 5 minute stroll to subway lines 1 and 5. It's also very close to Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a central location in Beijing and who would like convenience. I would also reccomend this place for any small group or family as it has all the amenities you require for a perfect stay. The central heating worked a treat in the unusually cold Spring in Beijing. Thanks for a great stay Betty!
********** po

The apartment is in a nice complex and there is a metro station about 10 minutes walk away. This makes getting around the city a bit easier because unless one speaks Mandarin communicating with the taxi drivers can sometimes be very difficult. The studio that I ended up staying in was on a different floor to the one originally booked but Nathan refunded me the difference. I was also assisted in queries of the area such as location of the metro and grocery stores. Overall I enjoyed my stay and found it to be good value for money.
********** po

Very convenient studio apartment! Will definitely book here again next time I'm in Beijing.
********** po

The studio was all right. Awesome view from the window. I liked to sit there and just watch the city. Nathan was helpful, clear. He picked up the phone anytime, and told the solution, if I had a problem. I can only recommend him... 
********** po

Great loccation. apartment just looks like the picture. nathan is nice.
********** po

Nathan and Vera have been very friendly and helpful. The apartment is clean and comfortable. It is near to Dongzhimen Subway Station too. Will definitely stay here again when I'm in Beijing.
********** po

The apartment was as advertised - in a good part of town inside a nice complex. We were just there one night, but ran into some minor problems that Nathan responded to immediately. Seems like a great host!
********** po

Great apartment! It's located in a 30-floor-building with security service and some international residents. The room is modern, spacious and clean, though it need some smaller cosmetic repairs. Nathan was very helpful and straightforward. I can totally recommend this place!
********** po

There are alot of problems with the apartment which does not show on the pictures. I stayed in Apt 1708 in Building 25, while my colleague stayed in another. Both apartments were quite run down - peeling paint, dirty curtains falling down, thin curtains that let in all the light in (I was awoken at 5am on both days by the sun) floors were dirty, shower had no shower curtain that the water leaked all the way to the kitchenette (I was moping up water from the floor at 10pm with the bath towels provided since there was nothing else I could use), etc. The girls from the rental company were very helpful but the apartments need a serious overhaul. I am staying in a great apartment now which I will review after I have checked out.
********** ng

First of all, superb location. literally at the end station of the airport express. you are 5 to 10 mins walking from everything you need, supermarts, local and international restaurants, shopping malls, etc. The apartment is safe, well equipped and maintained. The subway station is within 5 mins of the apartment and is on the tourist line (Line 2), which means that you are within 10 to 30 mins of most of the attractions located in the city. the team of Sheila, Tracy and Mr. Liu was absolutely superb in helping us to know a bit more about Beijing. My family of 5 enjoyed the experience in the apartments,
********** po

Wow!!! Excellent we arrived at 11:00pm check in and they were there to let us in. Amazing service clean and a good view. A must if you are staying in Beijing. Close to subway and everything else. I can't say enough how wonderful it was.
********** po

Very good location and easy to find. Check in was a breeze
********** po

Everything was great, the place is very well located and Kate and her boyfriend were great hosts.
********** po

Apartment was really clean, location and the view from our window is amazing, location is perfect if you like being in the centre. 10 minute walk to La Rambla, the owners are really friendly and their hospitality was precious, definitely will visit this place again ;)
********** po

We are very pleased to Kate for her hospitality, detailed instructions and clean home. We spent really cool time in Barcelona due to her home. Cool place! Better than we expected. Itâ€™s a walk distance to Rambla and Passeig de Gracia. Of course we will return next time.
********** po

My family and I had a good stay at Kate's place. It was very clean and location was great as It is central, close to lots of great restaurants and transport. Only issue was that it's is very loud at night as it's on the main road. The toilets are also shared with other guests. Overall, would recommend.
********** nt

The room was comfortable and Teresa was very kind and caring in letting us make use of the home.
********** po

Listing is accurate, Teresa was welcoming when we got there. There was a mix up in the morning, our check out wasnâ€™t until 12 but she told the next days guests to get there at 11 and we were all confused. Thereâ€™s a little balcony which is nice.
********** nt

We stayed at Teresaâ€™s place for a night and it was comfortable and nice staying there. Although we booked her place really late before we check in date, she responded early in the morning and accept our request. Location is not so close to the center but just 15 min by metro itâ€™s not a problem neither. She doesnâ€™t know English but she is using the Airbnb app by translating which solves the issue.
********** po

Compare to other accommodations this place is quite cheap, but it means that the location would be a bit far away from city centre.Besides, they do have air conditioner and fan in the room, so if you travel in summer, this situation should be considered. Except of these, the host is really nice and we still enjoy our time in Barcelona.
********** po

The flat is well situated. It's near metro station so you can be in the center in 15 minutes, on the other side it's in the quiter part of the city. In flat live Teresa with her daughter. Both of them are friendly and helful when you need.
********** po

Teresa's place was exactly as described and lovely and clean. It's right next to a metro stop as well so transport into the city is easy.
********** po

Teresa is a very helpful, friendly and welcoming host. The location is in a hilly neighbourhood but the flat is very close to a metro station (2 mins walk) and it is not difficult to get to the city centre.
********** po

Room clean and tidy in a well connected quarter (80meters from the metro station). Teresa has been very reactive to give us the indications to go to her place.
********** po

Room not very central but walking distance from Park Guell. The barrio is a residential area with shops all around. Very quiet in the night. Good value for price. Host kind and helping. Mattress new and comfy. Bathroom spacious. Thanks for hosting us.
********** po

This place isn't as great as it seems. It has potential but the pros do not outweigh the cons. I came here with a family of 4 and as soon as walking into the apartment we noticed it was extremely hot. We were told that the AC wasn't working and that a tech wouldn't be available until Monday (we checked in on a Saturday). The one bedroom with the double bed was a Sauna. The fan didn't help at all. Luckily later that night Laura brought an extra fan. Two of us slept in the living room as it was much cooler but the other two rooms were unbearable. In my opinion, what they charge is over priced for what is being offered. If you decide staying here during the summer i suggest you confirm the AC is working and will reach all of the bedrooms.
