Colleen was friendly and very helpful regarding directions, maps and suggestions for places to go. Her flat is centrally located and it's easy to walk about the city from there or catch a bus/taxi right outside of her door. The train is only minutes away too. The 'guest' has his/her own bedroom with a single bed and shares the bathroom. If I'm ever back in Sydney, I would certainly consider staying at Colleen's again. It was an enjoyable experience.
********** po

Great place, centrally located, easy walk to train station, bus station across the street. Walking distance to great bars, clubs, and restaurants. Very good price.
********** po

Colleen is very friendly and helpful. The apartment is nice and located conveniently.
********** po

Dear Colleen! My friend Diemut from Germany enjoyed it a lot to stay with you. She was pleased about your openness, friendliness and your support according to discover Sydney. --- So if somebody wants to experience Sydney go to Colleen!!! I wish you a lot of guests who are as 'wunderbar' (wonderful) as you are. Sincerely Sigrid
********** po

Lovely, interesting chats and very helpful giving directions to find your way in Sydney. Confortable room and very well located, if I come to Sydney again, certanly will consider go back with Colleen.
********** po

I liked to stay with Colleen.Quite interesting person, very open, giving lots of useful information. Nice location of the flat. Would stay again with her and meet again my great friend Challie (her cat)if (when?) returning to Sydney.
********** po

What a fantastic place to stay . Wish I could have stayed longer,will certainly reccomend to anyone and will return myself. Colleen is a very interesting person with lots of travel . Was made very welcone from the first moment. Many thanks Colleen hope we can keep in contact. norman
********** po

This was such a wonderful experience. Colleen was so helpful with written info on where to go what to see & how to get there and back. We even did a couple of trips together. The apartment was in a great location, with anything you need close by. Bus stop right out the front door, train station, grocery, & eateries all along the street.
********** po

Fantastic host and location. Colleen has a wonderful home and is very kind in helping navigate the area. I really enjoyed my stay and would stay here again. 
********** po

Colleen is one of those formidable women, full of energy and stories to tell. Her place is superbly located down the road from King's Cross train station in Sydney. The location gives you easy access to Sydney's main attractions. The bed is comfy and her cat adorable. She will try to convince you to take buses to go to most places, but I found out that most things are doable on foot and it is a pleasure to walk in Sydney.
********** po

This was my first Airbnb experience and I am hooked! these guys are glorious . The most gracious hosts with generous hearts. Of course they do have many years experience running a BnB in Mudgie so they know the drill but that aside , they were welcoming, friendly, and forthcoming. I don't know Sydney and they do - which was they main reason I wanted to stay with an airbnb host. This is a great way to beat the lonely hotel blues, a great way to get that 'in' on local knowledge. A lovely room to stay in, fresh and clean - a wonderful breakfast early saturday morning before my flight home ( for which I appreciate and am eternally thankful) the fluffiest happiest best behaved dog Kenji i have ever met, I thoroughly recommend these host and their home to all. . I think we are actually friends now! see you soon
********** po

As my first AirBnB experience, this was a magnificent introduction. Vinh and Stuart were superb hosts...and Kenji their Pomeranian, was equally enthusiastic but very well-behaved and unobtrusive. Their three-story terrace house was unpretentiously stylish but with a retreat-like, relaxed ambience, warm and light. The location was fantastically close to the essence of Sydney...Darling Harbour, Bay-side parks, the City, Circular Quay; all within an enjoyable walking distance.
In line with the AirBnB concept I felt the way in which we could share time was rich, informative and very flexible. I could come and go as I needed, enjoyed engaged conversation on occasions or the gift of attending to my own thoughts or activities comfortably as desired....A beautiful balance and repose. They also gave me access to their wifi which was great to maintain my internet commitments. Even though they were often out enjoying to their own social activities Stuart and Vinh ensured that my son (who was occasionally visiting me) and I, felt entirely at home and even cooked us both a delicious breakfast with organic-market bought ingredients the morning I was scheduled to leave. The previous day we'd shared a walk down to the monthly Saturday morning market by the bay. I benefited too from hearing of their travel experiences and valued the opportunity to ask about their business venture...where they help creative people define and empower themselves to 'Make Tomorrow (Website hidden by Airbnb) much so that I've chosen to use their services! So in essence...I'm very grateful, enthusiastic and inspired by the time spent with Vinh and Stuart and would highly recommend their 'AirBnB' experience. 
********** po

Like many others this was my first AirBnB experience. I picked their home because it looked so beautiful and well kept. Their home definitely exceeded my expectations. It was a real bonus when I realized just how close they were to the Darling Harbour. Although it was only for a day, I felt really welcomed and taken care of. They even had a very yummy custard bun for me upon my arrival. I didn't realize it would be so cold in Sydney this time of year and had only brought a thin hoody. It was so sweet and caring of Vinh to lend me his jacket for the day. When I returned after all the sight-seeing, we ended up hanging out and talked the night away. Even though we went to bed quite late, they were kind enough to wake up in the wee hours of the morning just to drive me to the airport! Vinh & Stuart made my stay in Sydney so memorable. I can't even begin to express how much their kindness has touched my heart. I did not feel like just someone renting a room, but rather a visiting friend.
********** po

Vinh and Stuart were very warm and hospitable, they did all they could to make our stay a comfortable one. We went to the market with their friends and enjoyed a delicious breakfast and lots of interesting conversation. We had a great time and would recommend them to everyone.
********** po

I had a wonderful experience staying with Vinh and Stuart. They were thoughtful, friendly and warm hosts, very considerate and lovely to chat with. Their home is well located on a street with a great bakery, pubs, small shops, etc., and the guestroom was very peaceful with a skylight and a comfy bed. Breakfasts were fantastic. Vihn is a great expert on Sydney and was very helpful for advice and suggestions on transport and things to do and see around town. Vihn and Stuart are lovely people and really made my stay enjoyable. I would certainly recommend staying with them! 
********** po

This was really a great experience. The house is comfortable, elegant, and I really felt welcomed. It's very well located and walking distance to Sydney downtown, many attractions, restaurants and pubs. They were also very helpful with suggestions for places and directions. Highly recommended!
********** po

Oh my, where do I even start? Staying at Vinh and Stu's was definitely the highlight of our Sydney trip. They were the most welcoming and hospitable hosts anyone could ever dream for. Before we went to Sydney, they sent us a very detailed information pack, that even included the best taxi route from the airport to their home! In short, they are the BEST! The food and beverage they provided was definitely top quality, and their kitchen was simply amazing and oh so fully equipped. After a healthy and yummy breakfast, we are off to a day of sight-seeing (usually planned with the help of Vinh and Stu), and every night when we come back home we look forward to the interesting conversations with them =) And I can't praise the apartment enough. The location was simply superb, bus stops literally at the door step, heaps and heaps of cafes and restaurants, and walking distance to the Fish Market!! As you all can see from the photos, they have an absolutely breath-taking apartment. And let me tell you a little secret - the apartment is exactly as gorgeous as the photos are! If that wasn't enough, I must confess that we seriously considered smuggling Kenji back to Melbourne with us... Hmmm... He is without a doubt the sweetest pup in the entire world. Extremely well behaved, he never barked once, and he just loves to cuddle and cuddle. Dear Vinh, Stu and Kenji, thank you guys SO much for making our Sydney trip, and firt AirBnB experience simply amazing! Hope to see you guys in Melbourne soon! =)
********** po

Ditto everything that has been said here about Vinh and Stuart (and of course Kenji, the best behaved Pom I have every met). They are the consummate hosts and they have a stellar location for exploring Sydney. We shared two fun evening dinners together. The experience was exactly what I was hoping for when I signed up for AirBnB-- truly traveling like a human with all of the personal contact and comfort that implies. I can only hope that the next time my travels take to me Sydney, Vinh and Stuart are still listing their room! Thank you guys, it was a wonderful experience. 
********** po

My husband and I stayed with Vinh and Stuart during our honeymoon in October 2010. Vinh and Stuart were wonderful hosts to us in their beautiful home, and left us feeling as though we were visiting friends visiting, not strangers in a far away land.I can't recommend them highly enough. My husband and I would love the opportunity to visit Sydney again someday, and look forward to seeing Vinh and Stuart when we do.
********** po

What an absolute delight to meet Stuart and Vinh. On arrival we received a very welcome pot of tea and sat chatting for about an hour before retiring. Vinh was very helpful listening and advising us on our near future venture to build a b&b in Tasmania. We are looking forward to keeping in touch and learning more through Vinh's business courses.
********** po

Morag from the moment i got to sydney was welcoming, friendly and very helpful. I went to Sydney to see Coldplay live at Allianz which was in walking distance from the terrace. Her dog Charlie is the cutest dog and very friendly. i would recommend anyone going to sydney to stay its very well located and Morag is the best host.
********** po

Morag is a very friendly person and took care of us well. Great bread, pastries, yogart, milk and coffee u never short of. Very cosy roon with a little Balcony and privacy maintained. Charlie the dog is so funny and cute. Easy access to all places around in short distances. Although we cannot chat long with Morag, we re glad and had a nice stay in Sydney. Recommend those bistros and restaurants around, amazing!
********** po

We had a great at the Terrace. The apartment was perfectly located, and Morag gave us some useful advice of where to go, how to go, things to see and do, restaurants, etc etc The room was really nice, and we had our own bathroom. We sincerely recommand Morag's place :)
********** po

Morag is a great host. The apartment is nice and like the pictures. The location is in walking distance to the nightlife of Sydney. If you need public transportation is also next to the accommodation. We would choose The Terrace again.
********** po

We stayed with Morag at 'The Terraces' for 7 nights during our stay in Sydney. The apartment is in a perfect location, within walking distance from the city centre and close to many restaurants and bars in nearby Darlinghurst/Kings Cross/Surry Hills! Although we didn't spend much time with Morag, she provided lots of helpful tips and advice on what to do and what to see in Sydney when we did see her (plus breakfast every day). We would definitely recommend this apartment to other air bnb'ers, as it is in a fab location!
********** po

We stayed six nights at The terrace. It sits in a great location, 5 mins walk to Hyde Park, 10 mins to Pitt St. The bus stop is right downstairs, there several buses to Opera house, Watson Bay, Bondi etc. Charlie, the little dog is cute and smart. Morag is very very kind,we thank her for her great patience by explaining the route twice or more. Lastly the breakfast, we had different taste bread every morning, what a happy holiday! 
********** po

Morag was kind and lovely woman. Also her place was nice and not too far for walking to a downtown. She was a great host and we're sure that whoever visits her will see how lovely she is.
********** po

We enjoyed a lovely long weekend at Morag's. She has a great set-up, so we felt we had our own private space. Morag made us feel very much at home. Would definitely stay there again. 
********** po

This was our 1st airbnb and a seamless experience. Great location for walking around the city, good sized room with a small balcony and own bathroom next door. Very comfortable bed, plenty of clothes storage space, local maps and info on things to do and the smell of fresh baked bread to wake up to along with croissants and coffee... all this offered by a lovely warm, helpful hostess.... couldn't have been happier with our choice for a 3 day stay in Sydney. Thanks Morag.
********** po

We had a pleasant stay at Morag's apartment. Our experience matched the descriptions on airbnb and made by reviewers before. Morag is a great host and she made our stay very comfortable. Particularly the well prepared 'welcome book' (written by Morag) was very useful to get to know Sydney and find treasures / must sees. The bedroom had a nice little balcony and was equipped with everything needed to make our stay perfect; however the bed was a little bit short for my height (1.92m). Overall a great experience recommendable to others who want to stay at a perfectly located place (bus stop nearby, a lot of sights in walking distance) in Sydney.
********** po

I would say this room is ideal for the single traveller. It is situated just off the kitchen so handy if you require a drink during the evening. Amanda I found was very accomadating as to your arrival time,as I arrived at 11-45 pm.Most of the time you are left on your own during the dayas Amanda works . Just across the road is Coopers Park which I found handy if one requires an early morning walk or workout beware of the heat. Only a 10 minute walk from Bondi Junction with its many cafes for breakfast or lunches,Rubys Café is a must . Catch a bus or train to any main part of Sydney. I heartily recommend this room to any visitor.
********** po

I booked the room for my friend who was visiting Sydney for four days. However, I had the chance to meet Amanda in person and have to say that she was super sweet and very helpful. My friend very much enjoyed her stay in the very nicely decorated und super clean appartment. Thank you very much Amanda!
********** po

I had a wonderful time at Amandas place. It is perfect to visit Sydney and she is a really friendly and cool host. Thanks Amanda!
********** po

Double room in a great location, perfect for the single traveller. Amanda is a friendly and accommodating host, happy to give recommendations when asked. The apartment is a 25 minute walk to Bondi beach and Double Bay, and 10 minutes walk to Bondi junction where you can get the train into the city within 20 minutes. 
********** po

Amanda was a wonderful host, making me feel very welcome and my stay very comfortable. The room was of excellent quality and the location couldn't have been better.
********** po

Comfortable. Quiet. Clean. Modern. Classy. Friendly.
********** po

Amandas place was just great. Her flat is near the beach and walking distance to bondi junction. Amanda is a really nice person and helped me out with my dumb tourist questions.
********** po

Amanda is a very good host. She was trying to do everything she could to make me comfortable with my work, and I'm very grateful for that! The room itself is nice and very clean. The location is convinient if you want to have both: fast access to the city and to the beach, plus it has two beautiful parks just round the corner. I had a pleasant time at Amanda's place!
********** po

It was my first time to use Airbnb. Amanda is very nice, helpful and considerate. The apartment and the bedroom for rent is small, cosy, and super clean. I love the greenery everywhere. The location is very good. Huge park outside the door. 10-15 minutes walk to the shopping center, 20 minutes to Bondi beach by bus, and 30 minutes to the city. But the wifi broke down for 3 weeks during I stay-- I hope it's OK now; there is no washing machine inside; and the refrigerator is almost full.
********** nt

Great location and room. Amanda is very welcoming and helpful, will not bother you even for a moment
********** po

An immaculate apartment with lots of natural light, it was a pleasure staying here. I didn't have a chance to see the pool, but Maria had thoughtfully put out extra towels in case we did. I would definitely think about staying here again!
********** po

Maria has a great appartment and was a considerate host. The pool is big enough to do laps and the warm spa was a a delight also. Maria made recommendations regarding eating transport and locale which were helpful. The Japanes restaurant on Miller St is wonderful and reasonably priced. Great place for business and pleasure. Book it!
********** po

Great flat, excellent hosting skills and delicious food for breakfast , thanks again Maria! Location for us was perfect, v handy for CBD and all the other trips to Manly, Bondi, Blue Mountains and the parking at Mclaren's building came in v handy (Sydney parking must be the most expensive that we've experienced in many years of travelling). The swimming pool came also v useful for early morning and late dips, perfect relaxation after lots of sightseeing & walking. We absolutely loved as well Maria's bed linen, as good as top hotels, we really felt like home. Hope to get back to Sydney next year an stay again at Maria's lovely flat.
********** po

Maria was a great host; friendly, helpful, flexible on check in and check out times and we felt very welcome in her home. She responded quickly to any queries we had before and after our arrival, and provided lots of extras, including toiletries and food to get us going over the first few days. Her apartment was spacious, clean, modern, comfortable and very well equipped. The apartment block has a comprehensive but simple to use security system and everyone we met within the building was friendly. There was easy access to the city via bus and train. The free secure parking made hiring a car for sightseeing further out of Sydney an easy option. We made full use of the pool and hot tub, which we very rarely saw anyone else using. The balconies provided some extra outside space but, as expected for the apartment block's situation in the business area, there are no open views. We would certainly recommend Maria as an excellent host and her apartment provided much much more than more expensive Sydney hotels. 
********** po

Maria is a diligent host and was a pleasure to deal with. She went above and beyond to ensure we had a pleasant stay. The apartment is in a great location, was clean and tidy and is equipped with everything you need.********** po

We are really glad we stayed in Maria's apartment! The place is really nice, well decorated and comfortable! Also it's so convenient (just 5 minutes away from the North Sydney station) and also 10 minutes away from some nice cafes near Crow Nest! Maria was so helpful and was always making sure we were fine! We'll definitely try to stay there next time we visit Sydney!  
********** po

Maria was a great host and made sure that we knew where everything in her apartment was. Her place was safe, comfortable and convenient, and my wife and I really enjoyed our stay there. I would highly recommend her place to anyone who would like to stay near the city.
********** po

We had a fantastic time at Maria's apartment. The property was well appointed and easily accessible to main transport links, it was very nicely decorated and very clean and easy to maintain. Maria thinks of the little things, groceries on arrival, additional towels - even a bottle of welcome wine! Wish we could have had more time to relax in the spa pool, and sit on the balcony! It felt like home for our entire stay and look forward to staying again in the future! Thanks Maria, 
Ellen & Scott
********** po

Great location, great apartment and an extremely helpful and diligent host. Highly recommended.
********** po

Maria could not have been more accommodating and friendly. Our needs were quite specific and nothing was too much for her.
********** po

The apartment was modern, clean and comfortable. Instructions were professional and easy to follow. Atari provided many great food/bar suggestions, including making several food guides available! Would stay here again without question!
********** po

thank you very much. we really enjoy Sydney :)
********** po

Great location, very nice flat, clean and tidy - a really good decicion for 2 people staying in sydney. Its so close to everything but really quiet! Very recommended!
********** po

The place is nice, but you might want to stay here just because Atari is a great host and will make everything extremely easy for you. He truly did everything possible to accommodate us. The place is in a great location. There is a bus to Bondi that stops right in front of the apartment. It's really close to George St and there are several nice restaurants around. There is a laundry and dryer in the apartment and also a dishwasher. The apartment is nice but not as nice as you might think based on the pictures. The building is an old warehouse and looks and smells like one. Someone smokes in the corridor outside the apartment and, although the smell never got into the apartment, you could smell it once you leave it. These are the only negative points. Frankly, I don't think that you can find a better deal in Sydney.
********** nt

I stayed in Atari's apartment for ten days in November. It was my first Airbnb experience and it was fantastic. I couldn't believe the value I was getting for the price I was paying. The apartment was in such a convenient location, it was beautiful and clean, and the free wireless internet was a godsend as I needed to be connected to my email constantly for work. Atari was very easy to communicate with, friendly and very helpful - going above and beyond the call of duty, pointing out the nearest best coffee! Great experience. Very happy customer!
********** po

Atari is a very good host. He did everything possibly to make his guests have a wonderful stay. The place is very clean and tidy. It's very spacious and very convenient, walking distance to town. I really enjoyed the stay at his apartment. It's such an amazing experience for an airbnb first timer. Thank you very much! :)
********** po

Beautiful apartment (should be in a design magazine!) in a great location in Sydney! Atari is also a great and accommodating host--could not have asked for a better experience.
********** po

Atari was an outstanding host providing both a fully functional and perfectly located apartment. He provided some sound advice on the neighbourhood's amenities and must-go places. We were extremely happy with the experience and fully endorse staying at his place!
********** po

The appartment is one of the best that I ever rented via Airbnb ! All communications with Atari went very smooth and check-in and check-out was flexible. I would totally recommend it and will rent it again next year.
********** po

My parent's stayed in Atari's apartment, they were very very happy with the flat. It is very clean, light and quiet. The kitchen is very well equipped and there are plenty of books and guides. Atari was very welcoming - thank you very much! They have asked to stay here again next time they come!
********** po

We loved this apartment! It is like a Parisian flat with a view of Bondi! Anything we needed was supplied. Any complications were solved immediately. We wanted to stay longer or come back, but it is so desirable it was already booked out. Lovely hostess, so attentive and helpful. We would come back and we recommend it highly!!
********** po

Awesome location and super convenient for public transport. The view is totally amazing. So much better value than staying in a hotel plus you get a friendly host. I would definetly stay there again!
********** po

 Great location. Ready for major renovation. Not clean, stained old uncomfortable bed. No lift, no micro and no car parking.
********** ng

How do i find the appropriate words to describe how much i loved this apartment and my time in it? I totally fell in love with the charming furniture and Susan beautiful paintings that add to the lovely Parisienne feel of it. The view of the beach and the sunrises/ sunsets from the living room is just breathtaking! Susan was a lovely host that made sure i felt at home and had everything i needed. I will definitely come back and stay there if its available!
********** po

Probably one of the best locations in Bondi Beach! Apartment is eclectic and has a great view. Aging around the edges, but all in all a very enjoyable stay.
********** po

Great location with even greater views. The hostess is very friendly and easy to communicate with. The apartment has a nice feel to it, the bed was comfy, and the high ceilings are nice. There's also some nice paintings on the walls which was also a plus. The apartment is aging a bit, so it may not be suitable for people who expect a super clean modern contemporary interior. We had a great stay and would definitely recommend it!
********** po

Off-Season May 3-May 20 and still a great place to stay. Even if it was too chilly for us to brave the water, the view out the huge bay window let us watch the more sturdy Aussies have at the gorgeous waves on Bondi Beach. If there is anyone else on Bondi claiming the Perfect Location I don't know where it would be. Susan's Bohemian hideaway is across the street from the best part of the beach and directly above the most popular bar on Campbell Parade (The Bier Garden) Less than 5 minutes to walk to IGA market and a bottle shop. You'll find Susan both charming and efficient in getting you set up in her apartment. This is the place to stay in Bondi if it is available.
********** po

The location was great, the apartment had character and style. We loved it. Susan couldn't have been more helpful. A pleasure to deal with.
********** po

Susan's apartment was a real find. The location was brilliant and the view from the window simply stunning. Her artistic background gives the apartment such a unique touch.
********** po

Susan's home is cozy, confortable and has terrific views of Bondi Beach. Plenty of storage and hanging space for clothes. Susan was very accommodating and went out of her way to greet us very early on our arrival. Susan is very warm and friendly. She gave us lots of good info on her apt and the area. We look forward to staying in Susan's home again. We had a wonderful stay. Darrell & Catherine
********** po

When staying at Studio Yindi i was a backpacker and hence the facilities seemed extremely luxurious. If you are looking for a nice place to crash then this is perfect. The hosts gave us a friendly welcome and the place itself is fairly well equipped. Lovely spacious area to chill out in with a small bedroom on the side. The kitchen facilities are not as brilliant as they could be - lacking an oven or hob, however if you are wanting to eat out a lot or can prepare microwave meals then this isn't an issue. It's a nice location with suitable walks around the area and a bus service nearby. I enjoyed staying here and would return.
********** po

Studio Yindi is by far the best value accommodation option in North Sydney. The price per square meter beats any other offer for sure... it has privacy and a small garden, parking is free (which is not so common in Sydney) and John is a great and helpful host. 
********** po

My partner, Mom and I stayed at Studio Yindi last week. The apartment had everything we needed - coffee maker, hairdryer, washing machine, and lots more. We loved the downtown Mosman area which is about a 15 minute walk from the studio (or a super short bus ride) and really enjoyed exploring surrounding Cremorne and Balmoral on foot.  Getting in and out of CBD by bus is super easy as well. John is a great host, I would definitely recommend this accommodation to others. ********** po

We stayed at studio yindi for a week in february and had a great stay. We travelled around sydney purely using buses and would recommend a look at the sydney buses website as the bus stop is a 5 minute walk. Mosman is a great area to stay in, and any travel to the CBD involves a wee trip over the harbour bridge which we never got bored of, and it is also quite handy for Manly and Balmoral beach which are both wonderful. John and Pam are excellent hosts and very knowledgable about Sydney in fact John even took us out in his boat which was one of the highlights of our trip. 
********** po

We enjoyed staying with John and Pam, who were very kind and gracious hosts.
********** po

John and Pam were excellent hosts, very helpful and informative about the local area. they arranged taxis etc without any problems at all. The apartment itself was certainly big enough for our family of 3 and we could have comfortably fitted another person in it. whilst it was described as a fully working kitchen it was only a portable 2 ring cooker and full laundry facilities - be aware the washing machine is shared with the main house and they require access to what is effectively your space to use it. it would also benefit from a thorough cleaning from top to bottom and we felt we left it cleaner than when we arrived although on the day we left the next people were due to arrive an hour after our vacating the property so we were asked to wash the bedding in time for the next person. this quick turnaround is not enough time to cater for people correctly. 
********** ng

We had a wonderful stay at Studio Yindi, which was lovely and fully equipped for our needs. The wireless internet was definitely a plus, and busing/ferrying into the city was convenient. 
********** po

We loved staying at Studio Yindi. Perfect position to see the Sydney sights, yet quiet and private. John and Pam were fantastic hosts...friendly and full of local knowledge and guidance. We would have liked to spend a bit more time getting to know them better, but everyone's schedules were very hectic! Next time John, I'll bring my paint clothes and give you a hand! The Studio itself is charming with everything we needed at hand. Waking up hearing the birds in the morning was wonderful...such a quiet street that it felt we could have been miles away from busy Sydney. Buses and ferries only a short walk away... perfect position. Thanks so much for helping make our stay so lovely...we'll be back for sure! xxx
********** po

John and Pam are good host who provide help whenever required.  We enjoy the 6-day stay at their studio.  The studio is tranquil and spacious with beautiful natural scene and nice neighbors. Transport is convenient to the city and the beaches nearby.  Remember to visit Manly and Balmoral Beach. They are fabulous!
********** po

John and Pam made us very welcome. John was kind enough to show us round the area in his car and gave us lifts to the ferry and restaurant area of Mosman. The accommodation is spacious but basic. The floor is mostly bare concrete, although there are a couple of rugs and the bedroom is carpeted. There is no oven, just a double hob. Also drying clothes in wet weather is a problem. The studio is in a pleasant street, very peaceful with a small garden. There is a regular bus service into the city. 
********** nt

The Tree Tops is fantastic. Very modern, quaint but its all you need, kitchen,sofa bed - that is SOOOOO comfortable....and fab shower/bathroom.....walking distance (2 min)to a few key amenities,coffee, bottleshop, convenience store and surf shop. The beach at Avalon/Whale or Palm Beach is fantastic. Open the windows, watch the sunrise in the a.m., and pet Marmelade when you leave the apartment the gentle giant..love her. Tracey & Christian are very nice and great hosts. Don't hesitate.  If you get a car they have spot for you...
********** po

Tracey's Tree Tops Studio is very beautiful and functional. The folding window gives way to a view onto the trees that does not seem to end. Walking distance from the beach. Other nature walks are also easily accessible. Ferry rides from Palm Beach are easy to get to, either by bus or bicycle. My husband and I have spent a lovely time at Tree Tops.
********** po

We had such a lovely time staying here. The place is immaculate and has everything you'd need for a short stay. Cooking facilities are there and we made use of that, too. There are very cute and thoughtful touches such as a range of DVDs with little reviews, soap, shampoo, beach towels and a little chocolate. We made great use of two bikes provided by Tracey and spent a day riding up to Palm Beach and back. Beautiful area and plenty of things to do! There's a great cafe just a couple of minute walk away and Avalon is very close as well for a bigger variety of shops and a supermarket. Tracey was quick to respond and very kind to take us in at the last minute. All over, a very relaxing stay with beautiful green views from the big sunny windows. 
********** po

Tree Tops was a great place to stay. Convenient location and quality fittings and amenities.
********** po

We loved our stay at treetops. Such a nice outlook. Well equipped and clean. The bottle of sparkling wine for our anniversary was really appreciated! Great range of DVD's too. Really nice relaxing weekend
********** po

A comfortable room in a smart condo development. Everything was kept very clean and I had the use of my own bathroom. Sujatha and her husband are great hosts - very friendly and accommodating. I'll be staying here again.
********** po

Stayed over at Sujatha's house for 3 good nights with my boyfriend. Sujatha and her husband are great hosts, very welcoming and friendly. The room is comfortable and clean. I'm happy to have my own bathroom as i'm particular with shared bathroom. The location is accessible. A few minutes walk from the house to nearest bus stop which can bring you to town.
Good place, good hosts, good price. Highly recommended!

It's been a lovely stay at Sujatha's. The room is clean and the location is just perfect for a stop-over in Singapore. I really enjoyed relaxing at the swimming pool after spending most of the day in the city. Thank you Sujatha.

Sujatha is a wonderful host and gives us a lot of help. The bedroom is cozy with a good view of the mountain. Bus stop is just around the corner. Though a little bit far from the entertainment hub of Singapore, Sujatha's condo is worth all the compliments in the world!
********** po

A wonderful experience & highly recommended! Sujatha has a very comfortable home and really made me feel welcome!! I am very grateful to Sujatha & her husband, Devi, and I look forward to seeing you both again soon. =))********** po
Sujatha was extremely good host. Our flight was almost 6 hrs early before the check-in time and we requested for an early check-in and she immediately accepted our request. Entire family was very friendly and we spent good time chatting on a weekend. The Place was so clean and tidy as shown in the pictures. I would recommend her place to any of friends visiting to Singapore Thanks a lot for a wonderful experience Regards Amith

Fran is an excellent host who provided everything i needed and it made my first airbnb experience a superb one.
********** po

Fran and family were absolutely fabulous! They were so welcoming and sweet. I felt like I was staying with old friends the minute I got there. The apartment is a little out of the city central, but I preferred that. Both Fran and her son Joshua made sure we had maps and metro cards and guided us around singapore making sure we didnt miss any highlights. They even brought me & my friend some of the durian fruit to try :) I highly, highly recommend staying here!
********** po

Fran is a very kind person and took very good care of us.
********** po

Fran is a welcoming host. Her home is awesome, clean and tidy. Highly recommended!!
********** po

Fran is very sweet person and excellent hose can recommend and definitely coming back to her place again.
********** po

An amazingly comfortable stay! Really really neat and I felt so much at home!! Fran and her family are absolutely lovely and very thoughtful as well! The neighborhood is Quite convenient with everything you need at walkable distance. 
********** po

What a fantastic stay! Fran makes me feel at home as soon as I reach her place. She picked me up and showed me the way. Her family has been extremely kind and generous in facilitating things that I needed. Would highly recommend this place to everyone who wishes to stay north of Singapore.
********** po

My stay with Fran and family was a delight, They are very friendly , honest and very helpful. This was my first airbnb experience and it was a success! The apartment is in walking distance from the station, shopping center and Woodlands is not far from the border of Malaysia . So you can easy go across the border and visit Johor Bahru. highly recommend staying there!
********** po

Fran's place was a block away from the MRT and was well connected.All amenities and 24 hr shops were near by. She even walked down to pick me up. Thanks Fran. The house is beautifully done up and has a cozy and comfortable feel. I was welcomed and treated like a family by them. Fran is extremely helpful and went out of her way to help me - for planning a trip to the fish farm OR to try and locate a conditioner for my wife. At the same time, they are discreet and respect your private. I never felt encroached upon my private space. Last but MOST importantly, Fran has a WONDERFUL family. And together, they all made me feel at home. I never felt that I met them for the first time. Fran is well travelled and my conversations with her were interesting and refreshing. Her husband and son, were also very humble, welcoming and helpful.They even dropped me to the airport when I was returning. If I ever go back to Spore alone, I know that I will go back to stay with her. And if I go there with my family, I will be sure to catch up with a dinner :)
********** po

I'm a French student who was looking for a place for some days in waiting to find a room nearby my exchange university and my stay in Fran's room has been my first Airbnb experience. To resume : it was PERFECT ! I met fantastic people (Fran and her family), helpful, kind, respectful, etc.. They are easygoing, you can speak with them about any topic (travels, music, religion..). They hosted me longer than it was planned and I thank them for it. Now I consider them as a second family in Singapore. I thank them for all advices they gave me about Singapore too. About the room and the flat, it was perfect too. A very nice place, clean, with all you need (MRT at 10 min walking distance,Foodcourt, Supermarket, etc...). If you look for a place to stay (outside the city), it is the place to go ! To finish : Thank you for all Fran and see you soon :)
********** po

The rooms were clean and tidy. Beds very comfortable. Thank you Belinda.
********** po

Good space and quite an interesting home in a quiet location - a lovely park across the road which is rare in Singapore. Nice place to stay if you are in big group as we were.
********** po

It was a comfortable place. Belinda was a kind and helpful woman who helped us have a nice accommodation there and find tourism sites easily. The place was beautiful and calm. The maids were helpful too. Totally it was very nice trip. BEAUTIFUL SINGAPORE
********** po

We are four mature age travellers and stayed for one night. We had a wonderfully warm reception on arrival and she allowed us to check in much earlier than is the usual case. Only a short taxi ride from the airport. We asked about getting into the city centre and we were escorted not only to the nearest bus stop, but also to the train station. And we were helped with buying our first train ticket. Excellent customer service! We had two bedrooms, both air conditioned with a clean shared bathroom. On our departure Belinda was still gracious and helpful: she made recommendations on what to see in our remaining time. Very concerned about us experiencing the best of what her town has to offer visitors.
********** po

Belinda is a great host! She helps you whenever you need asssistance. The house is well kept and maintained, though the rooms are not spotless but are clean, presentable and comfortable to live in. The location is unexpectedly convenient, you just need to walk 5 minutes to the bus stop at Siemei Road to take a bus to the MRT station just 2 bus stops away! The street is quiet and a small park just nearby with children playground and simple keep fit facilities. Thanks, Belinda, 
********** po

We have very happy holiday in Singapore. Ms.Belinda is very kind and helpful. She is very nice. All of us are very comfortable living there. Only one thing, there is a little far to the downtown. 
********** nt

Very good host and made out stay great
********** po

I booked this apartment for my friend, as he use airbnb very little. He's very happy to stay in Belinda's apartment, everything just same as pictures. Will come back again!
********** po

Even though just stayed for a couple hours(because we need to catch the early morning flight), the house keeper was super warm.We had a nice stay.
********** po

not bad
********** nt

Belinda is a kind host who certainly tries to accommodate your needs. We didn't see her much, but our interactions were certainly warm and respectful. The room is extremely spacious, and there is a cupboard to put luggage. There are other furniture around to make working easier. The shower is a shared shower, but it is cleaned daily, along with the room. Transportation is quite convenient once you learn the shortcut. While you have to take a bus to the MRT station (semei), it isn't that far once you get used to it.
********** po

Belinda has been very responsive: always pick up my calls, reply my emails right away.  She has been extremely helpful: SMSed with direction to the house, offered a ride to airport, an extra mattress for my son, helped us call taxi.  Overall, my 3-night stay at her place was very pleasant and well-worth the money.  The location is not that close to downtown, but being close to airport and the ferry is definitely a plus for us. 
********** po

Interesting guest house, and really convenient to airport, especially for short stays! Thanks again!
********** po

The place was nice and Belinda has provided all the necessary toiletries, coffee and water as well. We just found out the shortcut to the place on the night before leaving on the next day hahahaha.
********** po

We spent two nights in the room offered by Belinda near to the airport in Singapore. We were travelling as a family group, with two small children, and we needed a simple and relatively cheap place to sleep. It can be difficult to find hotel rooms that allow you to put extra beds on the floor for small kids. The room offered exactly what we were looking for. We applied to Belinda to stay in the room and she was very responsive and answered all our queries very well. Upon arrival we met Belinda and some other people that were staying in the house (it is a very big house). It was a very friendly reception and Belinda had put out two extra floor beds for the kids in our room which was great. The room itself was clean and comfortable although a little bit dated in its decor. There is a basic adjoining bathroom which is also shared by another guest room. Belinda and co were very helpful in getting us taxis arranged for trips to the zoo and airport early on the day of the departure. All in all it was a good experience and we would say that if you are looking for relatively cheap, basic, clean and comfortable accommodation near to the airport and expo in Singapore then this is a good option. Belinda was very professional and friendly in her approach to the whole experience.
********** po

Belinda's house was convenient as we arrived late in the day and were only really minutes from the airport. We soon got into the routine if taking bus 2 or 24 (end of the street, turn left and then across the road is the closest bus stop) to Tanah Merah MRT station. This is the shortest walk and we also did walk to Simei MRT station (through park across from the house to the right and walk down Simei Street 1 for 15 minutes) Closest shops are there too. I did use the washing machine, one of the maids will show you how and put on slippers that are at the back door when using the work area. Clothes will almost dry on the racks there and will finish off in an air-conditioned space (the bedroom!) Internet connectivity is good which my children enjoyed. Thanks to Belinda and John for showing us some of Singapore we may not have seen otherwise.
For the airport transfer we used bus 24 from the the stop near the end of the street. It goes to Terminals 1, 3 & 2 and the cost was $1.11 per person.
********** po

Definitely a budget choice for staying in Singapore. Belinda was very responsive and helpful, and professional. The room is clean and spacious with a fridge, a closet, and airconditioning. It is about 30-40 min from downtown if you want to use the public transportation sytem.
********** po

I chose the place as it is near to Singapore Expo, the destination I was heading to with my mother. It was few bus stops away. A fair price for a fair room with a shared bathroom. The tenant next door smoked in the bathroom, causing smell when I arrived. I messaged Belinda and she immediately warned them. However the next day they smoked again in the bathroom. Shame on the tenant. The housemaid was very friendly, her name is Dewi, assisted us in many areas, called cabs for us. Belinda also dropped us off at the airport at the end of the trip, very kind of her. Overall a pleasant trip.
********** po

We would very much like to thank Belinda for a lovely stay. Everybody was really friendly and it was fantastic were very welcome although it was still early in the morning. Her house is situated in a nice and cozy neighborhood where you feel save. It was a great place to rest after a long flight.
********** po

Pros Location: 2 bus stops from the airport Clean, average size, en suite bathroom (you feel like in a hotel) Sufficient Wi fi (varies from 5 to 25 Mbit/s) Cold air conditioning Tea and coffee facilities in the room Good quality to price ratio for Singapore Cons: Location: not central. 10min by bus +30min by train to the city center Like hotel: you have to fill a check-in form upon arrival. No interaction with the host (only with the cleaning lady who also lives in the house). The fridge is in your room so it shows you are not supposed to use kitchen facilities. Air con blows cold air right through one side of the bed so one might catch flue during the night.
********** nt

I stayed at Belinda's place for 4 nights during my vacation. Seeing the location on the map I had been prepared for airplane noise since Changi was located quite close, but I didn't have to worry about that. The surrounding area is a quiet, peaceful residential area. Bus no.38 gave me a quick acces to and from Simei MRT station. You might think you cannot pass from the east end of Simei Street 1 over to Jalan Pelatok, which is not the case; there is a small park in-between which you can easily walk across. Room was well cleaned up, cozy and big. Belinda and her family were very helpful, too bad I didn't have much time to talk to them though because I always went out early & came back late. Overall it was a very good first step for me to enter the world of Airbnb! 
********** po

A wonderful house with all the amenities, proximity to bus stop and train station... more importantly warm host who exceeded our expectations!
********** po

We had a wonderful stay of a week at Belinda's place recently. Situated in front of a lovely garden with exquisite green parrots, her big abode turned out to be a nest for us to rest and wake up refreshed everyday. It is very close to the airport and not very far from the Simei MRT. The caretaker's family is wonderful and the cleanliness is definitely commendable. Good privacy and a good heartland experience - away from the din and rustle of the crowded city area. Kitchen facilities, Internet and washer/dryer are also available. I will definitely consider Belinda's place for future stays. Great family to spend singapore vacation. Will go back again and again, if given a chance.
********** po

My family and I really enjoyed Belinda's top hospitality during our stay and I will definitely recommend Belinda's home to families, young couples, business and solo travelers. Easy access to the bus, underground and taxis (a taxi ride from Suntec to her home only amounts to 15 SGD, unless you love walking, I suggest you use taxis in Singapore). I look forward to staying at Belinda's home with my family in the near future when we visit Singapore again. Thanks Belinda for being an amazing host!
********** po 

It was unfortunate that Belinda was not arround as she had to be away from S'pore during our stay. The place is just like anybody's house. had it been very clean it would have appeared as a guesthouse. We have no complain. Maids, Jullie & Deuii, both are very coperative. Jullie took all the trouble to show us the way to the nearest MRT station, Semei. We should have stayed with her only, instead a few days in another hotel prior to this stay . Only disadvantage is the distance from the main city culture, but MRT made up all. Belinda can think of providing toilet soaps etc and a bare cup of tea in the morning to add to the homely ambience.
********** po

Positives are 1. Good value for money stay location for a family of 4 2. Safe place and decent location 3. Belinda and her family was extremely non intrusive 4. Very prompt with responses to emails and text messages Negatives are 1. Bathroom is not very child friendly. Also we were in for a shock that on day 3 & 4 we had to share a bathroom with a co-visitor 2. Towels were not changed everyday and were damp when we got back in the evening. Overall, I would be happy to recommend this to anyone who is in for some value for money travel. Will be great if Belinda and her team make this a bit more personal!
********** nt

Its is clean and nice room and the house is amazng. But the room is a bit small to fit 4 adults.
********** nt

it is a big room which was nice and very comfortable. the only drawback is that the bathroom is connected to the other room. it was quite uncomfortable having one bathroom for two rooms. lucky for us the other room wasn't occupied. the house is really big and spacious. the host is very nice and accommodating. she will give you advice and tips to help you around singapore. the attendants are also nice and pleasant. they will help you around the house if you need anything like if you want to cook. just for everyones information, there are 3 dogs in the house and 2 nice kids. overall the experience was great. the house really felt like home. you can freely go out and come home as you like.
********** po

beautiful house, our room was spacious, train station not a bad walk.
********** po

We did not meet Belinda although we were hoping we could have. Our flight arrived at 11:30pm and we arrived at the house before 12 and another guest let us in. One of the maids showed us to our room and we left at 9am the following morning and whilst we asked to meet Belinda the guests did not where she was. As the taxi was waiting we left. The room was good - the air conditioner worked well (needed in Singapore) and the bathroom was ok. It may have been a little different had the second bedroom been occupied and the bathroom had to be shared. I would stay here again and next time I would like to hopefully meet the host :-)
********** po

This is a great place with great people. We hope to come back whenever we come to Singapore
********** po

Belinda's Jumbo Room is very comfortable. It makes my family felt like at home. We enjoyed this home stay experience at Singapore. Highly recommended!
********** po

Belinda's accommodation was lovely and had everything we needed. We stayed with our 18 month old son and Belinda's family were very helpful. It was very close to the international airport but a little way (20 to 30 minute train)from most of the major hot spots. Since we had a young person the journey was sometimes too far but it was one of the few places e could find in Singapore with microwave, iron and space for our son to play. There was also a fantastic park just across the road which was very clean and well maintained which our son loved and there was lots of climbing walls and ropes obstacles for the older kids. We would stay there again.
********** po

Well, I and my colleagues booked Jumbo Room for a seminar which was held on 9-11 September. We stayed for 4 nights at the top floor. The room is very clean and comfortable for 7 of us since it is huge enough. The room with air con, TV as well as other facilities such as iron that very helpful when we need it. The hot water helped me after the tiring seminar day. 
Thank you Mrs. Belinda, will be stay here again when we come. And I personally plan to come in March next year, will get in touch when it is fix. 
********** po

The room is spacious and clean. The room has sloping ceilings, so you need to watch your head, but it is very workable. 
Simei MRT station is very close (10-15 min walk) and convenient. MRT is easy to use in Singapore, and we never waited more than 5 minutes for a train. Belinda and her family were very welcoming and helpful. We know where to go next time we go to Singapore!
********** po

The place and rooms are clean and quite comfortable, it just the air conditioners on the fourth floor room blowing directly to our heads, and made the corner beds on right side of the door become so icy cold event though I have set the temperature to 25-26 degree Celsius. The Bathroom condition is acceptable for us. Clean towels are provided, which I did not expect at all, because it's not stated in the ads. Belinda is very friendly and helpful. She let my mother to sleep on the ground floor's room as my mother has problem with her knees to climb the stairs. I really appreciate the help of Isni, Belinda's helper, as she showed us the way to go to the MRT from the house, which takes about 15 - 20 minutes walking distance and she carry my youngest son on her bike to there. Belinda also very flexible, as she let us arrive on her place earlier than 12 pm and leave her place around 4.30 am to catch our flight back home. Overall, I really appreciate Belinda for her hospitality during our one night stay in her house. I made sure we did not make a mess and noises, so I hope Belinda happy on the condition of the rooms as we left. 
********** po
 
First of all Thanks to the host and house maintain person. We arrived bit late even though request for early checking and everything was ready to go. This apartment is same as what described in the picture. They have many historical items may be in another 10 years you can see only in museum. Everything was good and we enjoyed our stay. Only one thing which my parents faced difficulties was claiming 4 floors every day. They allowed us to cook dinner which is additional plus. Overall nice experience 
********** po

I had a great experience at Belinda's. She is a lovely lady and her family and helpers were amazing to us. The bedroom was nice and cool to get away from the heat of Singapore for a minute. The house is close to the airport , walking distance from a shopping centre so, it's quite cheap to catch a taxi if you don't want to bus around. 
********** po

It is just okay
********** po

This place is nice for groups, in a great neighborhood and close to subway station

Bianca is a gracious host and her lovely home provides a cool haven from the vibrancy of Singapore. We loved being on the green train line with direct connections to the airport and downtown Singapore. Public transport in Singapore could not be simpler and Bianca's home is (as she states) literally 3 minutes walk from the station. We enjoyed the exotic ambiance at Bianca's home and particularly liked getting to know our lovely hostess. Bianca is a wealth of knowledge and made plenty of time to share this with us. She made us a yummy breakfast each morning and good coffee. We felt fortified and ready to meet the world. My impression was that Bianca is a very flexible person who will willingly accommodate the particular requirements of each guest. Our room (the Leopard room) was well appointed - complete with air con, fan, fabulous bed, towels, sheets, tea making facilities, plenty of wardrobe space, ipad, internet connection, lovely ensuite - all carrying Bianca's specific flair. We have already booked our next stay with Bianca!
********** po

We thoroughly enjoyed our return stay with Bianca. Her home is delightful and her company even more so. Biana brought Singapore to life for us and the 3 days were not long enough to enjoy all of the wonderful experiences on offer. We would highly recommend a stay at Bianca's home to singles, couples or small families looking for an authentic Singaporean experience. We look forward to our next visit!
********** po

It was my first time on AirBnB and I would say I've been very fortunate to have experienced it with Bianca. What a gracious hostess!! The room we got was perfect and the location of the house is convenient. I hope to encounter more Biancas' on AirBnB and other countries.
********** po

I stayed with Bianca for 4 nights in April 2012 with my wife + my wife's family. It was a great experience. The house is spotless clean and the location is superb. Bianca also finds the perfect balance between the professional host and a great friend. She respects your privacy and at the same time always available for a good chat and laugh. Excellent host and accomodation! Highly recommended.
********** po

This was my first experience in any BnB and it was a very pleasant one. I have become a fan of BnB and am planning not to stay at hotels in my future trips. Bianca, my host @ Leopard Tree was fun to be with and very well read and informative. As I was on a house hunting trip, Bianca became my friend and adviser for areas to live in, things to do and all other well needed information and advise. As for my room, it was very well furnished with all the necessary items that made it a complete home stay. Very nice breakfast everyday and I even got to accompany Bianca for awesome pork curry cooked by her mum-in-law. I would recommend Bianca's place to anyone coming down to Singapore for a pleasant stay. 
********** po

I have many experience stayed at great hotels and it was my first experience on airbnb which makes me worried, but you know what? I don't think that I'm going to consider to stay at a hotel in Singapore anymore because this place is just PERFECT than any other 5star hotels. Lovely house, great location. And nice, warm, genial host Bianca! She can't be perfect more than this. I really enjoyed having chat with Bianca. She has very sophisticated taste, you can see it every place in the house. If I have a chance to visit Singapore, I'll definitely stay in Bianca's house. Super highly recommend.
********** po

Bianca is a wonderful, gracious and thoughtful host! Her house is lovely and super convinient to the MRT. We stayed in the Leopard room which has a nice comfortable sofa bed in addition to the regular bed. The attached bathroom is very nice with a superb shower and nice size tub! The breakfasts served was delicious and Bianca is great company. When my son got sick during the trip and we were housebound, Bianca was super helpful and kind! Thank you, Bianca!
********** po

Just half a year ago, my mother was dubious of my interest in Airbnb, but after her first Airbnb stay with Bianca, she has nothing but positive things to say. Traveling together with my sister, our experience at The Breezy East was unanimously a remarkable one. Bianca is a truly genuine and passionate host, who welcomed us with warm generosity. She embraces the diversity of her guests and goes out of her way to accommodate different needs and wishes. Bianca has a great sense of humor, a sleeve full of brilliant suggestions of places to see and experience, and interesting stories to share. The breakfast that is provided each morning is very fulfilling, and one time when I slept in quite late, she cordially brought the food upstairs to our room. The room Leopard Tree was a perfect fit for us. It had everything you need and more - ironing board, robes, television (which was great for us to catch up with the Olympics), tea and cups, toiletries, and a fantastic bathroom. Furthermore, Bianca's home is the exemplification of a 'retreat' in a calming suburb, but access to the city is still very much convenient and swift. We had the opportunity to meet other Airbnb travellers during our stay, making our experience that much more exciting. The Breezy East is undoubtedly a must-visit gem. 
********** po

Our 4 night stay with Bianca was amazing! Firstly Bianca was a most thoughtful and generous host - she is an excellent ambassador for Singapore - her information, stories and breakfasts were fabulous. And she even came with us to eat the best laksa as well as taking us to the light show. Other important facts - Bianca always quickly responded to queries and the information she provided was accurate. The room - The Leopard - was very comfortable, quiet and clean. Her home is more impressive than the photos demonstrate and we were made to feel very welcome.The location of The Breezy East is convenient as it is only a 5 minute walk from the effecient MRT subway system. We can't thank Bianca enough for our wonderful stay in Singapore.
********** po

Bianca is a treasure, truly a Singaporean ambassador as another reviewer stated and a most gracious host. Our time at Breezy East Leopard 7N/6D was wonderful in every aspect. We can highly recommend. After being in Singapore all day it was such a pleasure to come back to her lovely and comfortable home and take in all the amenities the Leopard room offered. It was Bianca who made our stay in Singapore smooth and easy with her flexability, accomodation and attention to detail as well as being so informative! Her home is beautiful and yet it is Bianca who makes it truly a home away from home. She is available if you need anything yet is respectful of privacy. Her care started from the moment we inquired about the room and carried through to our departure. Before we arrived Bianca checked with us regarding dietary restrictions (which was highly appreciated). Arriving by MRT from the airport was a breeze as stated in her very detailed and helpful House Manual. Being so close to the train station made things simple and convenient. Mornings I was able to practice yoga and meditation on the rooftop deck and watch the sun rise over Singapore. After that we had a delicious (and always different) breakfast that included scrumptious Singaporean specialities- not an easy feat given that we are gluten and dairy free! Our room was well-equipped and lacking nothing - comfortable bed, luxurious sheets and robes, air con, MRT passes, wi-fi, ipad and docking station, tea and coffee making facilities, large wardrobe space, sofa, ensuite spacious bathroom with a nice shower and large tub. The room was spacious, quiet and very serene with a lovely treetop view and birds to serenade you in the morning. We also enjoyed the massage chair and foot reflexology apparatus after a long day in the city.We loved the ambiance and beauty of Bianca's home and her company and are already looking forward to our next trip to Singapore. 
********** po

My 18 days stay in Singapore at Belinda's place was just great. Not only that the place is only a mere 2-3 minutes walk from two bus routes, MRT is also close by. The place is exceptionally clean & quiet, and you are received with a warm smile & hot coffee. The nearest 7-11 is a very short walk. If the host has time, she enjoys giving guidance on city tours and places to visit. Belinda even took me in her free time in her car to show me around. 
********** po

I had a great stay !!Everything was perfect !!I totally recommand this place !!!!
********** po

It is really a budget stay here but in walking distance to the Expo as advertised. The host are friendly and help with the taxi every time I made the request. I used this place for sleep only but others can have a great time at the Playground just opposite of the house.
********** po

We are a couple of French travelers aged 56 and 61. We enjoyed our stay in the house of Belinda. The house is clean, quiet and comfortable. The home maintenance staff is friendly and helpful. The metro station is 1/4 hour walk. With the metro you can go in downtown Singapore in 1/2 hour. However, we booked the budget room. The website say that the room is for one person but you can add an extra mattress on the floor for a second person. But the room is really small for two people. We did not know where to put our luggage. We have therefore chosen to move to a more expensive room, on the first floor with private bathroom and refrigerator. The price was S $ 100 for one night. Not at all the same price as the budget room. The wireless internet connection is very good. We were able to use the washing machine for our clothes. It was not a problem for us but there are two small dogs in the house. We recommend the budget for a single room. For couples, it is best to book the more expensive room upstairs. Nous sommes un couple de voyageurs français âgés de 56 et 61. Nous avons apprécié notre séjour dans la maison de Belinda. La maison est propre, calme et confortable. Le personnel qui entretien la maison est aimable et serviable. La station de métro se trouve à 1/4 d'heure de marche. Le métro permet d'aller dans le centre ville de Singapour en 1/2 heure. En revanche, nous avions réservé la budget room. Le site internet indique que la chambre est pour une personne mais qu'on peut rajouter un matelas pour une seconde personne. Mais la chambre est vraiment petite pour deux personnes de notre âge. Nous ne savions pas où poser nos bagages. Nous avons donc choisi de nous installer dans une autre chambre, plus chère au premier étage avec salle d'eau privée et réfrigérateur. Le prix était de 100 $S pour une nuit. Pas du tout le même prix que la budget room. La connexion internet sans-fil est très bonne. Nous avons pu utiliser la machine à laver pour notre linge. Ce n'était pas un problème pour nous mais il y a deux petits chiens dans la maison. Nous recommandons la budget room pour une personne seule. Pour les couples, il est préférable de réserver la chambre plus chère à l'étage.
********** nt

It was the second time my wife and I stayed with Belinda, however, it was for 1 month and a great experience. 2 people can easily fit into the budget room depending on how one places their luggage, clothes and bedding. Belinda has always been helpful on phone and email and in person, get the know her well and you will understand that she's not just a great host but a fantastic friend overall who's blessed with a great and supportive family and dedicated home-stay staff. A special mention goes out to 'Aiyee' with whom we had many enjoyable nights dining together - she might be old and aged but she definitely knows how to party! We will be booking Belinda's place again when we're back in Singapore next year : -)
********** po

Belinda and her staff we absolutely wonderful to stay with and they made me feel at home, were very warm, welcoming and helpful. The room is not large, but was perfect for me to stay in for a month. I often went to Starbucks to work, but there is a table and chair in the room I used several times, so it is large enough for both sleeping and working. The location is excellent, close to the airport for when you first arrive and a 10 minute walk to Simei station and mall. The washroom seemed odd to me at first, but it is actually very typical Singapore style with the shower, toilet and sink in the same area. Anyways, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay, and will likely return. :)
********** po

Very close and easy to get to from the airport. I attended a conference at EXPO and it is only 5mins cab ride. Clean, comfortable and private accommodation. I was upgraded to a larger room and this was a bonus! Belinda and her family and staff are very friendly and extremely helpful. I enjoyed long conversations with Belinda. The place is 10-15min walk/bus to closest train station and shopping complex with local eateries definitely worth checking out!
********** po

Me and my husband stayed at the budget room for 2 nights during Chinese New Year 1st and 2nd day. We boarded the airport bus and alighted at Merra Terr bus stop, 1st bus stop once hit the Upper Changi East Road. Thanks for Belinda's clear instruction, we manage to find the house without any difficulty. We reached the house quite early around 10 + in the morning and glad that we can check-in way earlier than the stated time. Mary(Belinda's helper) greeted us at the door and even walked us to the Simei MRT station as we are not sure of the location *thumbs up* She also woke up as early as 6am to help us to call the cab to the airport on the day we checked-out. All in all, it was a great stay. Location near the airport is a plus point.
********** po

The pictures of the room, kitchen and bathroom/toilet are accurate. Directions to get to the accommodation and access to the city are accurate. The room is located in a big home which was in a nice and safe area. This room is at a low budget standard, very similar to a room in  back packer accommodation. My disappointment was that the house keepers did not know I was due to book in on that day, despite myself emailing the host ( who was not in Singapore) the day before, of my arrival date and time. When I saw the room, it was dirty and very untidy. There was definitely a poor hygiene smell in the outside kitchen area ( which the budget guests are to use). Seeing the room and the kitchen, I was very tempted to walk out that day and notify Airbnb. I did stay on, because the house keepers were helpful, cleaned the room and did their best to accommodate myself and the range of guests staying in many rooms of this home. However, at times there continued to be smells which indicated poor level of hygiene in the outside kitchen. I could often smell dog faeces and urine- the smells would come into in the outside kitchen area . Dogs are confined in cages and small enclosures near the outside kitchen but do not have access to the kitchen . I assume that the dogs are walked during the day . Many birds fly into this outside kitchen area to collect food scraps.

I would stay Again at bilindas place, it is close to airport and Only 10 minute walk to the train station. I was lucky to be Upgraded to the larger room with wifi and tv, her maid is Very nice and helpful,, place very clean ( just watch the bottom Step!!!)

Elizabeth is very kind. We had a happy holiday. Thank you!
********** po

I was very fortunate to stay with Elizabeth who is a lovely lady with a cute house in one of the most convenient locations in Singapore. The road is quiet with a nice park and restaurants nearby. Public transport is also within short walking distance. Tourist information and toiletries were available in the room which was clean and well presented and cosy. Elizabeth was a superb host whom I got on with very well. I was lucky enough to be taken around the city with her and meet her friends who live and work here. I would strongly recommend this location to anyone looking to stay in Singapore. Thanks for being a great host and making my stay so enjoyable. Thanks Liz!!
********** po

The house is as perfect as i came to here last time .Elizabeth is very patient and told me about the house. Although we still can't meet , I felt like a home here.Thanks for Elizabeth .
********** po
It's so interesting that me and another girl who was checking in and out on same dates as mine, similar age and backgrounds, also coming from the same city, met in Betty's house!! That's why Betty got a bit confused at first for recognizing us. But her notes and info for checking in was very clear and she's very responsive during our communication. The house locates in a very convenient area of downtown. Close to MRT. One stop to orchard. Quiet and comfy. Especially the bed was so soft and comfy that released the whole day tiredness when lying on it. Quite value for money for solo travelers. Will def recommend Betty's place to friends when they travel to Singapore!
********** po

Elizabeth was very quick to respond. She constantly kept in contact with me to make sure I felt comfortable and that everything was alright. She also went the extra mile to share her list of favourite food and recommendation of places to get discounted attraction tickets in Singapore. Unfortunately I was in SG for a work trip, thus did not have the opportunity to try them. I really enjoyed the location of this stay. The house is nicely tucked in a lovely and quiet neighbourhood. As mentioned on this listing, it is only a 5-8 minutes walk from the nearest MRT Station. The walk to and from Newton MRT station was very enjoyable because of the lush greenery around. This would be an excellent choice if you would like to experience a quiet local Singaporean neighbourhood away from the hustle and bustle of the city.
********** po

This apartment is in a perfect location -- two blocks from the beach and two blocks from the Copacabana Palace (where anyone famous stays when they are in Rio), which means it´s a very safe neighborhood. The pictures very accurately depict what the apartment is like, so you´ll have no surprises. Max is very communicative and helpful. The four of us that stayed here would highly recommend it.
********** po

we had a really great experience staying in Max's apartment. it was one block from copacabana beach with easy access to the local markets/shops. Max was very helpful and went out of his way to send a list of suggestions on things to do. I will refer friends to Max in the future if visiting Rio. Thanks for everything Max!
********** po

Staying in Max appartment is like living in a cosy little French village and enyoing at te same time round the corner all the facilities that Rio has to offer (metro, bus, shops, restaurants, supermarkets, and of course Copa Cabana beach). Fantastic terrace, nicely decorated rooms, two spacious bedrooms, attentive doormen, and a host who really cares for his guests. Jan & Iet  
********** po

In general very good and reasonable price. It is really great having local calls for free.It give an extra service to the apartment and tourists in Rio. Things that can be better: - towells in different colours, for differ the towels of each person (it is a bit silly...) - Air conditioning in the rooms - DVD device included to the TV - Some more kitchen things and better heating kitchen system (os fogos da cozinha electricos sao um poco lentos para cozinhar) All the rest was correct, we will recommend the apart for other people.
********** po

The apt was nice and in a great location only a couple of blocks from the beach and shopping. Thanks for everything Max!
********** po

At Copacabana apartment is best the situation and BALCONY! Thanks Max (hope the door is fixed!)
********** po

A great apartment in a great location. The close proximity to transportation, supermarkets and everyday needs was really helpful. Max was very helpful and accommodating.
********** po

Apartment is exactly as Max advertised. If we had any issues, he immediately solved them. In addition, the terrace was a welcome addition. However, the neighborhood is a bit dodgy. The neighbors would throw trash on the terrace which we had to toss out for them every day. Next time my friends and I will stay in Ipanema. 
********** nt

Great apartment, amazing price and location in a pedestrianised street with a great atmosphere and large bedrooms, living room and balcony. The only downside was the kitchen with two small electric hobs but we managed to get by and everything else more than made up for it. I would recommend this place to anyone!
********** po

Max was very organised and understanding to all our needs. He was very clear and honest with his apartment. The apartment was clean, safe and all the amenities was true. Very close to copacobana beach and local shops and metro station(2mins). Quiet at night when sleeping in a pretty safe neighbourhood. Strongly recommend Max's apartment and will stay here if I'm back in Rio again. Thanks Max!
********** po

Me and my girlfriend spent 8 days in rio, we loved it the apartment was very clean, in a great location and very nicelly decorated. everything was very smooth with viviane and she went out of her way and spent time with us to let us know about the best spots in the city. she was able to give lots of insight about spots not known by turist. 
thank you viviane. Eduardo 
********** po

Great apartment, great location, and a wondeful host. Anything you need, Viviane is there. Rio was ten times more enjoyable because of her help. 
********** po

I heard of AirBnB from a Bloomberg article (Website hidden by Airbnb) I was skeptical at first. I made many inquiries to hosts but Viviane was the only host who contacted me. She responded to every inquiry quickly. I needed to know if she used a modem and router to provide high speed internet. Many people provide usb modems that are very slow. I heard many horror stories from people who rented apartments in Rio like they charge you one price but demand another upon your arrival, they overcharge you all together, the apartments were nasty, and so on. The apartment was very clean. I had everything I needed. The location was very good. The art inside the apartment was nice. Viviane was very professional and responsible. She even provided me with transit information upon my arrival to make my journey to the apartment easier. I lost my key and she responded to the emergency quickly. Viviane took the time to meet with me and introduce me to different restaurants and other places of interest in the neighborhood. She answered every question that I had and provided good insight into life in Rio.  Overall she is an amazing host with an amazing story. I would recommend her to my friends and will rent from her again.
********** po

The apartment was lovely, clean, and well located. We unfortunately didn't get to meet Viviane but she seems really nice on the phone and was attentive to our needs. Highly recommend.
********** po

Lovely lady, and gorgeous little studio apartment in great location. Very much enjoyed my stay and would definitely stay again if ever in Rio!
********** po

Viviane is very flexible and very easy going. She is trustworthy and very helpful. She helped us settle in even though she couldn't be there, we met her brother when checking out. She made sure we could always contact her or a relative and everyone spoke English.
********** po

We had a very nice and good stay in the apartment. Viviane was very a good host and We only have good things to say about our stay.
********** po

The apartment was spotless and as depicted in the photos. We didn't get a chance to meet Viviane. but she was available by email to answer our questions. We met Viviane's brother when we checked out, who was kind enough to hail us a cab in the rain, so we and our luggage didn't get wet. We enjoyed staying here.
********** po

The apartment is sleekly stylish, ultra-convenient, & Viviane could not have been more accommodating. She is lively & friendly (her photo reflects her personality). Gave us a very generous & thorough orientation & followed up with tips for navigating & enjoying Rio; always responded promptly to our communications, & especially to our odd schedule & special requests.
********** po

On our second stay at Vivian's apartment, she was as generous & helpful as the first time. Couldn't have been better.
********** po

First off, we'd like to premise this review by emphasizing need to have the ability to break out ratings into different categories, because Renata's place scores very high in some areas while lower in others. In terms of location, this apartment cannot be beat. You can sink you feet into the finest sands of Ipanema in two blocks (5 minute walk). The portion of the beach closest to her apartment was also the least crowded. Walk two blocks towards Leblon and you're at the footsteps of Shopping Leblon, which offers some of the finest shopping in all of Rio. Within 50 meters of the door you can choose from a number of cheap and delicious dining options, have your laundry washed and folded, order freshly squeezed acai juice and surf the web and print docs at the adjoined Internet cafe.Now let's discuss the apartment. We really loved that there was a 24x7 doorman. The doorman not only allowed us to feel safe but proved to be extremely useful for calling cabs. (Don't forget to tip your doorman!) The apartment's interior, with its uniquely colored walls, creative art and fixtures reflects cute design elements that can likely be attributed to Renata's design background.Now let's move on to the reasons why the apartment received only three stars. The facilities and amenities had a dorm-like feel. While there is a microwave, there is no stove top which constrained our options for dining in. Unless you are sleeping solo in the double bed, you will likely be sleeping on a futon bed. On the plus side there are multiple beds available, which would make this place ideal for three or four people as long as you're willing to sleep on an air mattress, double or futon. The shower was quirky, but after some experimentation we managed to figure out an adequate mix of hot water and water pressure. One issue, which may be of more importance to some than others, is that there is no dedicated Internet wifi. This proved to be quite an inconvenience since few cafes in Rio offer wifi to guests. As Renata had pointed out there is a strong free wifi signal at the Starbucks in the shopping mall, which we found ourselves using on a regular basis.The biggest plus of the apartment's amenities is the AC unit which is a very big deal in Rio! Renata only asks that you turn off the AC when it's not being used. In closing, Renata, was very sweet and helpful and we enjoyed working with her. As long as you are willing to accept a few quirks, this apartment is a good value in the most prime location in all of Rio. 
********** nt

My boyfriend and I spent 4 days/3 nights at Renata's apartment in Ipanema and had a great stay. The apartment was simple but comfortable - exactly what we expected based on the honest description and photos posted online. The location itself cannot be beat - right between Ipanema and Leblon - and the price is certainly right. Renata was extremely helpful and left a number of maps, resources and recommendations as to dining and shopping in the area. Also worth mentioning is the 24hr security service - we always felt safe during our stay. Renata was also extremely flexible with respect to our arrival and departure times, which was helpful as we arrived at 5am. The key was waiting with the doorman and we were able to let ourselves in and get some rest after traveling overnight. I would definitely recommend this rental.
********** po

Great place and even better location. I had a good friend from Fortaleza visit and we stayed at her place for 3days/4nights to take advantage of the apartment's location. It was everything that we were looking for and either close to everything my friend wanted to see in Rio or near access points for us to get to our destination. There were two of us so we used the futon and the single bed - both are what you would expect (meaning, a futon is a futon). Clean apt, clean sheets, clean everything; shower pressure/temperature was spot on. Minutes away from the beach, shopping, etc. There is no stove top as the previous reviewer mention but my friend didn't come to Rio to stay inside and cook so that wasn't an issue for us. Definitely plan on staying again. One other thing to mention that's equally as important as the place - the host. Renata was super friendly, helpful and responded to our inquiries quickly. When you're booking at the last minute like we did (sorry airbnb!), having someone responsive to answer questions made everything so much easier. Thank you Renata! 
********** po

Great location, the condo is really good set up. security is good. if you are coming to Rio de Janeiro this is a great option!! 
********** po

The Location is more than perfect !!! And it was easy getting key etc.
********** po

This apt is definitely recommended! Renata's apartment is a GREAT location. Very close to the beach and right in the center of all the good and fun restaurants. Its on the verge of Ipanema and Leblon, 2 good/safe/nice areas of Rio. The apt is a good space for two, there is a fridge, little sink. Security is great, doorman are extremely nice. Only thing was that we found the double bed in the main room a bit too hard (this is of course a personal preference). There is a single futon and single bed/couch in 'entrance' room, we did not try these but they look softer. Renata was very helpful with her quick responses and tips around the area and extreme pleasant to deal with regarding the apt and days of use. THANKS! Definitely an awesome catch if you are considering to holiday in Rio and renting an apt!
********** po

Amazing location, convenient, safe. Apartment is cute and has everything you need. All in all a fantastic deal and great place to stay in fabulous Rio. 
********** po

I have rented Renata's place already twice in the last few months. Unfortunately the standard of apartments and hotels in Rio is generally very bad both in terms of quality and price. Compared to most apartments you find in Rio (including the ones on airbnb), Renata's place is actually pretty fair. The location is the main plus, being right between Ipanema and Leblon and two blocks from the beach (the beach is never too far in Rio though). Yet, the apartment is very small and could do with some improvement, neither of the beds is particularly comfortable, there s no real kitchen to cook and there is no internet connection, which for me is a big drawback. Overall I would recommend it to anyone looking for a basic, clean and convenient location in Ipanema but not for longer stays.
********** nt

We loved our stay in Rio in Renata's flat and will definitely want to stay there when we come back. The apt has everything you need and is very comfortable. Most of all, the location is perfect: not only is the flat two blocks away from the beach but also it is located in what we found was the best spot in Rio: between Leblon & Ipanema. And if you have any question, you can ask Renata or the doormen who will be happy yo help you out. 
********** po

The apartment was lovely, in an excellent location, and aesthetically well-designed. Excellent value for Rio. A great place from where to enjoy the city, very safe and secure. The only downside is no Wifi. Otherwise it was very nice. ********** po

The flat is in a very good location to get to the touristic places - you have buses straight to the sugarloaf and cristo rei and you can easily walk to cooacabana, ipanema and leblon! This should also be one of the safest places to stay in Rio. It's a very tidy and cosy flat and you will find everything you need to stay for short or longer periods - I personally stayed 4 days. I had an issue with Internet connection but you can rest assured Patricia did everything in her power to sort it - you won't find yourself with no support if anything happens! I will highly recommend you to stay in Patricia's flat - I would stay there myself if I return to Rio! 
********** po

I stayed in this apartment for two nights. You can hardly call it an apartment, it is a real artwork! Spacious rooms (I stayed alone) are brilliantly decorated, they are clean and equipped with everything I needed. The location of the apartment is perfect, it is only in 5 minutes walk from the main beaches or Rio (Ipanema and Copacabana) with lots of restaurants and entertainment. As most of the houses in this area it is 24/7 secured by the doorman, so you can really feel safe. I did not meet Patricia personally, but we were always in contact and she gave me all required instructions by messages/phone to make my stay in Rio really pleasant. At the time of booking the offer from Patricia was one of the best in this area. I would definitely recommend this place for the travelers who want to get the best impression of the wonderful city of Rio.
********** po

Great place. Great value. Great location! Patricia is a wonderful host. Highly recommended!
********** po

Great Apartment with perfect location for the Beach. Lovely Host who is very welcoming :) Will return again! thanks very much for the great experience! 
********** po

Patricia's flat is in the perfect location to see Rio. The apartment is the perfect size for a couple and has a great bathroom shower, AC, and great living room area. We didn't use the kitchen, but if we come again and stay longer it seems to have all the essentials. Patricia was very helpful in helping us plan our time in Brazil, couldn't have done such a good trip with out her help.
********** po

We stayed in this apartment as a last stop of a trip trough all major cities of Brazil. It was by far the best experience of them all. The apartment has a perfect location, between Copacabana and Ipanema beach. It provides everything you need in all privacy and comfort. Patricia is very kind and helpful with everything you need. I recommend it! 
********** po

Live New year in Rio was amazing. Unfortunately we could'nt met Patricia but Guillermo received us and show all we need to live in this beautiful apartment. The neighborhood is great too. Very close to beaches and shops. Hope to go there soon. Regards Patricia and Guillermo!
********** po

We spent a week in Patricia's apartment in early February and found it to be extremely convenient, safe and comfortable. Cozy decor, lots of closet space and good kitchen for quick meals. A few minutes walk to local grocery store, Metro and the beach. Had a great time. 10 minute walk to see the best sunset in the world on rocks at Arpoador. 
********** po

I just returned from a month stay at Patricia's place in Rio and it was fantastic! For me it was in the perfect location central to everywhere I wanted to be. I would walk just minutes to the beach every morning to surf at Arpoador, and return in the evening to catch the amazing sunsets. Communication with Patricia was great. She checked in to make sure everything was going well and I had everything I needed to enjoy my stay. Since I am a single guy and for the first week had another friend with me I admit we made quite the mess. Patricia sent her maid over who worked magic and left the apartment back spotless! I hope next time I come back to Rio there will be availability so I can stay at Patricia's again. I would recommend this apartment to everyone. Obrigado. 
********** po

Very nice and cosy apartment, very lovely and charmingly decorated. The house has a 24-hour doorman, the street is safe and fairly calm. Fast wifi. Decent bed. The location between Ipanema and Copacabana is really perfect! Only a few minutes walk to both beaches or the metro station. Supermarket on the next corner, nice cafés and restaurants within easy walking distance. Patricia is a very friendly and nice host - and a quick communicator. Very generous to allow a late check out. Thank you again for that, Patricia!! The only thing that was not perfect: the apartment seemed to be a bit damp, which may be hard to avoid in Rio. We smelled it - and in the bathroom you can see it on the walls. However, still definitely recommended. 
********** po

patricia was a wonderful host and really helpful with everything. her apartment is great; really close to everything nice in copacabana. i'm sorry i had to go back home.
********** po

After our trip to Rio De Jenario, it was clear that there are 2 important things for me: 1- Convenience 2- Security. Patricia's apartment provided these 2 things very well because: 1- Its location is in a perfect spot. Apartment is by the beach in Copacabana and it's 10-15 min walking distance from the Ipanema Beach, just a block away from the bus stops. Also there are a lot of nice restaurants around the apartment for breakfast / lunch and dinner. 2- Patricia provided every single detail to have the best sightseeing in Rio and that was very helpful. 3- Pictures on the website are not misleading and you get what you see. It's perfect for 2 people. It was clean, A/C was working perfectly and she also provided a lot of clean towels which was very nice of her. 4- The building was very secure, it was well protected and this is really important in Rio. Bottom line, Rio is a very interesting and beautiful city. If you'd like to go there you should stay somewhere secure and close to either Copacabana Beach or Ipenema Beach and Patricia's apartment is just by the ocean and you can enjoy both beaches. Patrica and all the other stuff are so polite, kind and helpful. I strongly recommend her apartment.
********** po

The apartment had everything I needed, and the location is fantastic. The hosts were cooperative, super-helpful and friendly, and I now consider them as my friends. Barry S Vancouver BC Canada
********** po

We didn't have the opportunity to meet Patricia but I can say that she is one of the most respectfull hostess that i ever had. She sent us a guide of what to do in Rio and we anjoyed everything she said. The apartment location is great because you have a lot of points to go out and the beach is just in front of you. Hope to meet her soon because everybody who knows Rio wants to come back. Thanks and good luck!
********** po

Affordable, Clean, Great location, Helpful host, Safe! How much more can you ask for?! We had a great time thank you!
********** po

We had a very pleasant stay at the apartment. The staff was very friendly and we appriciated it that we could mail Patricia about all our questions. We will for sure recommend this place to our friends when they come to Rio!!!
********** po

I felt comfortable in this cozy studio. When I arrived, there was cold water in the fridge and some small snacks on on the table, which was a nice touch. It was pleasant to be able to look out of the window and see the beach and feel the ocean breeze. There's also a great natural vegetarian self-service restaurant right next door. I never actually met Patricia, but she was easy to communicate with via email. The doorman was also great and very helpful. His wife actually did my laundry for a small fee, which was cheaper than taking it to laundry service, and was more convenient since I just left it at the front desk and it was ready the next day.
********** po

Sousa Lima was a fantastic place to stay! Very comfortable for 3 people, clean and well looked after. Clean sheets, towels, cooking utencils, detergents were all provided. Patricia and Paulo were very kind, helpful people. They left helpful hints on things to do and places to see in Rio. Which were all fantastic! The apartment was in the perfect loocation, sitting between city and beach - also very close by to the beautiful Impanema beach. If we were to return to Rio, we would definately use this apartment again! 
********** po

The apartment is well situated for both Copacabana and Impanema. Patricia was the perfect host,i was collected and dropped off at the airport. On my arrival at the apartment i found a well stocked fridge with drinks,selection of fruit chocolates and nuts and fresh towels and bed linen. Patricia also left me a guide on the the whys and wherefores of Rio which was very helpful. The apartment is well located for restaurants and a number of good coffee shops for breakfast. I would have not problem in coming back to the apartment or recommending it to anyone else. All the staff at the apartment are also very helpful.
********** po

Patricia and her husband Paulo are the perfect hosts. The apartment is everything as advertised, and then more! I was welcomed with a basket of fruit; the apartment was spotless, and a 1 minute walk to Copacabana beach. Patricia and Paulo are incredibly helpful with all questions, and always available for help. They are wonderful people, and the apartment is perfect!
********** po

Amazing appartment, amazing location, amazing host! Next time we're in Rio we will definitely stay here!
********** po

I've been to Rio many times, and this is by far the best stay i had. Service is Great (internet, tv, hot water, laundry, cleanliness and more...), breakfast deliciious and i think it's the best location in the City. Fantastic! Will definetly be back
********** po

Could't possibly be better! The place is very nice and clean, as well as spacious. House personnel was adorable and super professional. Great breakfast in the morning. Location cannot be better...just a short walk from Ipanema beach and very close to the most popular bars and restaurants in the city. And it is still a quiet place! We were a large group so we had some complaints for being a little loud the first night...but then everything worked perfect. Thanks Sacha and your wonderful team for our wonderful stay!
********** po

The place was comfortable and easy to get to. The owner is very helpful and accommodating. We loved the place, it provided a much needed haven after a very busy time at JMJ 2013.
********** po

We had a fantastic Holliday staying in the 6 bedroom penthouse. And in the end much more value for money than staying at a random boutique hotel. The location is superb. Just around the corner from posto no.9 where it's all happening. We were welcomed by Maria the cleaning lady who had been a great help and made us feel safe and at home. I would recommend this place to any flashpacker like ourselves! Sara
********** po

Excellent house excellent location. Very friendly maid and host responded quickly to any questions. Clean, nice, all expectations exceeded Thanks
********** po

Great location on prime street in Ipanema less than a block from the beach. Very safe and nice area. Bath amenities and souvenir Brazil flags left in each bedroom. Everything was very clean and lovely maids made breakfast every morning with eggs and coffee and fresh fruit. Great wifi service and Sonos as well. Also very good air conditioning in each bedroom. That all said, the apartment in real life does not look nearly as nice as it does in the photos. Each bathroom is a hodgepodge of different plumbing fixtures. One shower has the boiler controls in the wall inside the shower. Water in the front unit (with balcony) ran hot and cold which made showering interesting. Also a toilet in one of the front bedrooms has an electric pump to help it flush. This is fine, except it also had a water leak from the tank to the bowl so the pump was activated every few minutes and the noise made sleeping in the bedroom impossible. The whole place could use a professional paint job. Overall it's a nice space with great potential but all feels a little too unfinished for what they are charging.
********** nt

Lovely flat great location. Large inside with a fab balcony facing east so bathed in light in the morning
********** po

I totally recommend Alex's Penthouse for any group that wishes to be close to the beach in Ipanema. The quality of the premises are five-star, the cleaning service is great and the breakfast is waiting for you every morning in the terrace. Great experience and great service from Alex both prior and during our stay.
********** po

Alex was an amazing host and made us feel very welcome. The listing was accurate. The neighbourhood couldn't be any better - the apartment is 50 meters from the best beach in Rio (Ipanema). 
********** po

Although, as a non-Portuguese speaking visitor I faced a few logistical challenges due to communication and language barriers, staying in this Apartment was a Great experience! It is very clean, well-appointed and safe, with a gated entry and doorman. The fact that the apartment is a 12th floor unit (with elevator access) also added to my sense of security and provided a breath-taking view of Copacabana Beach. But who goes to Rio to stay inside? The Apartment is located a block from the soft and warm sands of Copacabana Beach in a neighborhood that has a good mix of locals and tourists, with anything you might need just steps away. The location will only be enhanced following the completion of the new Museum of Image and Sound across the street, designed by the celebrated American Architects who designed the very successful High Line and Lincoln Center renovations in New York.  The Apartment is also within walking distance to Ipanema and the subway. Convenient transport from the airport is available at an additional cost. Overall, a great place, just wish I knew a little more Portuguese! I can't wait to go back!
********** po

I loved my time in this studio, clean, with air conditioner, internet and tv working perfectly, 24 hours doorman, near to everything, including the beach, and with an amazing view of Copacabana beach. 
********** po

The place it's simply awesome, with spectacular views and convenient stores, pharmacys, bus stops and most importantly beaches all around. Very recommendable!!!!
********** po

The apartment was just as it had appeared in the photos. The location was perfect and the view of the beach was fabulous. We really appreciated the safety of the building, with the doorman present 24/7. Additionally, David responded promptly to any questions we had for him. All in all, we would recommend this apartment as a great place to stay. 
********** po

very nice room, prefect location and very good stay in Rio!
********** po

Excellent location. Excellent value for the price. David is very easy to communicate with.
********** po

Everything was perfect! It had what we were looking for: cleanliness and centrally located. Thank you David for the smooth process. Overall, it was a great experience!
********** po

THIS PLACE WAS IN AN AWESOME LOCATION. RIGHT BETWEEN THE 2 BEST BEACHS COPACABANA & IPANEMA. YOU COULD NOT ASK FOR A BETTER LOCATION.  GREAT VIEW, GREAT ROOM, CLEAN, ACCESS NEAR TO EVERYTHING. IT EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS. I PLAN TO GO AGAIN AND WILL DEFINATELY USE DAVID ONCE AGAIN! HATS OFF TO A GREAT TIME IN RIO!!!!
********** po

I had a great stay in David's apartment. I didn't meet David but he communicated promptly by text and email. The apartment is small but fine for for one person or a couple. It is very close to the beach and restaurants which was great, but with this proximity comes a little noise in such a busy area. There is also some construction noise during the day, but this was not a concern for me because I was sightseeing for most of this time. I recommend this apartment for a visit to Copacabana. 
********** nt

Great location short walk from the beach. Comfortable studio. David is very responsive and most helpful. He and his handyman Peter do everything they can to make your stay comfortable. Highly recommend.
********** po

Great location, right on the beach. Having lived in Rio before, you really can't be in a better part of town. Sasha is great and his team of housekeepers were lovely and very helpful. All in all a great stay, and I hope to be able to go back there.
********** po

Excellent stay at the Ipanema Penthouse - Sasha, the owner, was very helpful and assisted us in anything we needed. The apartment is split into 2 separate rental spaces on one level - so 3 bedrooms at the rear and 3 at the front. The front section has been remodeled, 3 great bedrooms, living space and has an amazing terrace with views over Ipanema beach- the rear section is OK but not as nice as the front section. You should also be aware that all cooking/cleaning preperations happen in the rear rental space. Sasha very kindly moved us to the front section :-) We had an amazing breakfast served by the maid each day - very nice touch :-) Felt very safe and secure in this area, even at night time. Highly recommended!!

Great location, great price compared to hotel. Smooth check-in and check-out. Would definitely stay again when next in Rio!
********** po

This apartment was perfect for us! Ideal location, perfect interior, and great maid service. Highly recommended to anyone interested in having a great time in Rio. Sacha really made the extra effort to help us out. The maid came to the apartment at 5:30 AM to help us with a complication before my flight at 8 AM!
********** po

Perfect place ! Great location, very clean, spacious, stylish with very good service and attention both by owner and the housekeeper. 100% recommended !
********** po

The location of the apartment is excellent and less than one block to one of the best sections of Ipanema beach. The building is secure, with a doorman 24 hours per day. The apartment itself is spacious and has three bedrooms and three full bathrooms. The owners were very helpful and responsive to Airbnb messages during our stay and also very flexible with check in and check out times. They even sent us a bottle of champagne as we were on our honeymoon. There is a maid at the apartment quite a bit during the stay. She made us a full breakfast each morning and did our laundry. She speaks no English and we communicated by gesturing and through the owners. We asked the owners that the maid not be in the apartment in the evening, and they made sure of it. Overall, the apartment is nice, very well located, and an extraordinary value if two couples share the three bedroom space. The owners are very responsive, and I would stay in the Beach Block Apartment again. 
********** po

Perfect position. It was the perfect apartment for our holiday.
********** po

I enjoyed my stay there. Perfect place! 100% recommended!
********** po

This place is amazing! The host is super cool and the place is very nice and the beach is right out the door. Nicely furnished, and the screening room is great too. 
********** po

Nice apartment with excellent bedrooms. Privacy was a bit lacking as there weren't full blinds for each room and people could see (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication wasn't the greatest as we never received a reply regarding tours (luckily we booked these ourselves). Something we weren't aware of at the time was the maids do not work over the weekend so there was no breakfast included or laundry facilities available until Monday.
********** ng

The appartment is very well located, between Copacabana and Ipanema, with metro, plenty of buses, shops, a couple of laundries, an exchange agency... and the beach just a 50 m. It's also well equipped, internet works reasonably well and the views from the window are very nice. The only negative thing is the noise from the street but this is something very commun in Rio: buildings aren't properly insulated. Dalia is a nice person. She showed me the neighborhood and gave me some tips to enjoy Rio. Highly recommended. 
********** po

Dalia's place was clean, bright, and in the perfect location for our stay during new years. She showed us around on the first day and gave us wonderful suggestions on things to do. We always felt safe and had very easy access to everything the city has to offer. There's even a great coffee shop and bakery right across the street, and so many good places to eat and drink that you'll never be bored here.
********** po

Host was great with introducing me to the neighborhood. The location is great, kitty cornered from Post 5 copa beach. 
The apartment is not equipped for cooking, eventhough there is tiny stove top and tiny sink....there is no counter space. The bathroom is big though so I guess it depends on what matters to you. Street noise is very loud, it didnt bother me but could be an issue for others. Concierge was very helpful.
********** nt

The apartment has an ideal location in Rio. sittue it close to the end of copacabana and the beginning of the Ipanema beach. Equipment is perfect for enjoying the city and close to amenities. Metro Station is and bus station are also next to the apartment. Arriving in a big city like Rio, I think there is no better host than Dalia . We expected to find someone who would rent us the apartment, and we finally found a sister who explained the operation of the city, which has brought us safe. I highly recommend Dalia, as host, and even as Friend. Now, we can not imagine traveling to Rio without give her a Hug. Dalia : thank you for everything you taught us, thank you for your confidence. We sincerely hope to see you soon in France and Brazil. kisses.<3
********** po

My boyfriend and I stayed in Dalia's apartment during our recent stay in Rio and had a fantastic experience. Dalia met us on our first day and was so kind and excited to help us. She genuinely cared that our trip went well. The highlight of the apartment is the location. The apartment's location is perfect - it is right across the street from the beach and, even though it's technically located at the end of Copacabana, you can very quickly walk to Ipanema too. Very convenient; you'll be steps away from bars, shops, restaurants, nightclubs, and Arpoador Point - which is the best place to watch sunsets on the beach. The apartment also has a big bathroom with a big countertop and an awesome rain shower head that I wish I had at home! There's also plenty of room in the apartment and it has a convenient desk with fast wireless internet, which is really useful for looking up places to go or even reading restaurant reviews on Kekanto (Brazilian Yelp). When you go to the beach, you can also leave your keys with the doorman, which is useful when you don't want to have to worry about them!

i had a wonderful stay. Everything from start to the end was perfect. Will come back again.
********** po

Charles is just amazing and he made my stay special. He is so nice, helpful and absolutely polite. Charles is always there when you need some advice or help and totally respects your privacy too. I could concentrate on my work while Charles was doing his work - also absolutely quiet. The apartment is perfectly tidy, very clean, with tasty furniture and beautiful details. My bedroom even had a desk in it. Also, the apartment is located in a perfect area, most sightseeing spots are in walking distance and there are some very nice restaurants around as well. I highly recommend this place! 
********** po

Staying with Chas was an absolute pleasure. He was very accommodating and respectful of personal space. He is truly a nice person. He was very helpful and I am grateful that he opened up his home to me. I am glad to have met him.
********** po

Charles is a most wonderful host. I enjoyed my stay, the bed is comfortable, and the apartment is well appointed and always clean. Thanks Charles for a fantastic Airbnb experience. 
********** po

Chas is a really good host. He gives me a lot of good advice during my stay. Always trying to make my stay as much comfortable as possible.
********** po

Chas house feels like home, it is clean, it has bright energy, it’s mystical, it’s fabulous. Charles is a very hospitable man, kind and soft hearted, he made me feel well looked after and confortable. Thank you for your time, I learned about myself.
********** po

1. Clean 2. Host is very friendly 3. Reasonable price 4. Good location 5.Very comfortable to use buses and subways 6. Much better than pictures 7. With sauna, swimming pool, gym, laundry room
I recommend this room! It was much better than a hotel. :)
********** po

Wow; Charles was a delight to meet a very warm and friendly man whom made me feel comfortable and at ease throughout my stay. Truly someone I will remember for his warmth and generosity. The apartment was homley and the location was perfect for anyone whom is looking for central proximity. I strongly recomend this place as your 1st choice.
********** po

Chas. has a great space ! Loved how clean everything was and how available he was to help out with anything I needed!
********** po

Chas is a great host, very friendly and welcoming (and informative!). He keeps his place spotless and quiet, so this is a great location for people looking to relax or reset from a day out in Los Angeles. The location is amazing and walkable to many stores and restaurants. I especially enjoyed the in-building sauna and spa as a way to unwind at the end of the day.  In addition, the underground, secured parking is a great find (especially in the summer heat). I'll definitely stay here next time I'm in the area.
********** po

Louise Diana gave me a very warm welcome ! The place is very clean and ideally situated just a few blocks from Venice Beach. Louise is a very interesting person and her place was like an oasis during my holidays. Go go go !!
********** po

The bed is a pull out loveseat in the ground level living room, open to the kitchen-there is a wall of windows next to the bed, open with no window treatment-the landing on the stairs looks directly down onto the bed-the bathroom is on the second level of the townhouse. The positive aspect of this experience was the response, service and help I received from the staff of airbnb. Rachel B and Johnny M went well above and beyond in their efforts to assist me. Thank you airbnb!
********** nt

I had an absolutely fantastic stay with Rev. Dr. Louise-Diana. Her hospitality, kindness, conversations, and helpful information made me feel welcome in her home. The location was excellent it is near everything, from the 3rd Street Promenade to Venice Beach or even the Santa Monica Pier; all the sites are close by. I highly recommend staying with the good Dr. if you’re visiting the Santa Monica area. 
********** po

Very nice place, very quite, near the beach, near all what you need (restaurants, pubs, supermarkets...). Louise-Diana is a very facinating and very welcoming person. Don't hesitate, if you want to spend relaxed time, it is the right place with the right person !
********** po

Louise-Diana was nice and her apartment is in an awesome location (I used to live 3 blocks away yrs ago). However, the pull out love seat bed was unbearable. I canceled my stay the next day and got refunded after sending in photos of the mattress. It's a cheap love seat, maybe 15 yrs old, with metal bars poking your back through the 2 inch, cheap mattress. Fabric is torn in many places as with the matching furniture. I got 3 uneasy hours of sleep. The apartment is also quite dated, stuffy, and not as nice as the photos and word 'townhouse' seem to impart. I'd charge a bit less for it. Otherwise I'd rate the rest as fair to good. Louise-Diana is cheerful and easy going. With a new bed, she'll be in much better shape. I LOVED my 1st 2 AirBnB experiences in Italy, this makes me more careful when choosing, and I'll avoid pull-out couches!
********** ng

Louise-Diana is the sweetest gal ever! She accommodated me extremely last minute with open arms. Her apartment is beautiful -- she has a beautiful garden right beside the sofa. Her apartment is a few blocks from the beach, the farm market -- and great shops. I didn't have a car so I walked everywhere and it was wonderful! Made a new friend and will definitely stay again when I'm back in town! 
********** po

had a great time with louisa-diana. great location. quiet, leafy and serene. 6 min bike ride to wholefoods & other little shops n restaurants. 5 mins walk from main st with everything you'll ever need. and of course 7 mins walk from the beach too. Me and Louisa D saw man of steel together. it was ghastly. 
********** po

Wonderful lady with a sweet place for newbies in LA. Best location where is 5-mins walk from Santa Monica Beach and all kinds of stores & supermarket. I stay with this lady 3 weeks, she's super nice to me. Looked out for me, was thoughtful with everything, and helped me solve all my problems. In a word,she and her place is the best you can got.
********** po

The house was absolutely delightful with a lovely garden where I could enjoy Santa Monica´s weather to the max. It was very clean and comfortable, quiet and I felt at home since the moment I stepped in. The location was absolutely perfect with the beach just a couple of blocks away, a grocery store to a walking distance, cafes, restaurants and trendy stores just around the corner. Rev-Dr. Louise Diana was very kind, welcoming and sweet. She was very nice to be around and a very thoughtful host. I will definitely stay here when I´m back in Santa Monica! :)
********** po

The most WONDERFUL 8 weeks. Could not be happier. My host was super friendly, cosy, wonderful and kind and I absolutely adored my time with her. Its a fabulous location and a really lovely space. - cosy and warm and spacious - Id go back in a heartbeat! .. 
********** po

I loved my time at the circle. My hosts were warm and helpful and the environment a wonderful respite from the energy of LA. I would certainly recommend to others seeking a place to connect with others, a soft landing, in a gorgeous environment.
********* po

The space is small and sweet. For those attempting to travel around Los Angeles without a car, it is possible to do this here. The bathroom was a bit like camping, but the funky folks that stay at the Circle make up for it.
********** nt

My stay at The Circle was very enjoyable. Accommodations are rustic but filled with openness and warmth. Don't expect air conditioning and dimmable recessed lights. Rather, expect the smell of the eucalyptis through the windows on a warm summer breeze. Located a stone's throw to Venice & marina Del Ray, convenient to Santa Monica, Wilshire/Westwood, Culver City. Convenient, and VERY quiet at night.
********** po

I stay with Sanni every time I'm in Los Angeles. She's an excellent hostess, always granting privacy--and free WiFi--while thoughtfully anticipating needs (extra pillows) and providing unexpected treats (a bottle full of homemade soda). They've recently redone the bathroom, and it's utterly charming: a pine and pebble Elfin retreat. I LOVE this little Bohemian hideaway.
********** po

I will just re-affirm what everyone else is already saying about this place. It's beautiful, peaceful, artsy, quiet, but not far from night life if that's what you're after. We really enjoyed our stay and will stay here again if/when we come back to LA.
********** po

They are nice people but next time I'd pitch a tent on the beach rather than kick it in the treehouse at $65 a night. It is miles from the beach. Sani wasn't there and I never got a cupcake with a candle. Cold with no heat, spiderwebs, musty smell, bedding didn't appear freshly laundered, super steep ladder type stairs so you better not need to use the bathroom in the middle of the night, which I could never find anyway. For me at least even on this website appear to be far better choices for $65 a night, but to each their own and peace.
********** ng

Sanni has created a sanctuary in Los Angeles, and we couldn't have felt more blessed to have found a place to call home for our visit. Her home and studio radiate love and interactive ways of being with each other, and the environment surrounding. The circle bed is amazing. AMAZING.
********** po

Had a great time in your quirky abode. Many thanks for the kind hospitality.
********** po

Very nice and peaceful place! Not so close to the beach though, but it you can get there by bike. Unfortunately, I could'nt get to know Sanni, but she made sure everything was ok for me and I definitely enjoyed my stay!
********** po

Sadly i didn't get to meet Sanni but she was really prompt with emails and was very accommodating. i absolutely loved the floating bed and have decided to buy one. its so nice being rocked to sleep everynight :) i hope we cross paths in the future. 
********** po

The hosts were helpful and gracious. Apartment impeccable. The view was magnificent! Experience Malibu for yourself. We'd love to return someday!
********** po

If you are looking for a place to stay in the hills of Malibu a little way away from the city, this is the perfect spot. It has the most amazing view of the ocean. It's quiet and just serene. Larry and Nancy were attentive and reachable by text. The check in and check out process was seamless. The house is high up in the hills and has everything you need you have a lovely Malibu stay. I didn't want to leave. 
********** po

a beautiful place to stay, not far from anything with a lovely view and fun hikes close by. we loved our stay, our hosts were welcoming and quick with a tour upon our arrival. a detailed packet of restaurants and fun things to do in the surrounding area was helpful and thorough. we will go back!
********** po

Larry and Nancy were wonderful hosts. The apartment is beautiful and has a magnificent view. Perfect!
********** po

Larry was a great host, he was very helpful all along my stay for any request. The appartment is very confortable, well-equipped and the view is awesome. It is close to most of beaches and suffitiently far from the highway to be not disturbed by the noise.

********** po
It was a pleasant experience. We had an amazing view of ocean, a quiet and serene place to be. I will return to this place.
********** po

Beautiful Malibu house with fabulous views from living room and bedroom. Lovely Patio to eat breakfast in looking at the ocean. We even spotted a few spouts in the ocean from the house. Lovely host who was very courteous and went above and beyond in trying to make us feel welcome and comfortable. Highly recommend.********** po

LOOK NO FURTHER !!! If you want a PERFECT Malibu experience, this delightful apartment rental is it !!!!
We stayed 4 days and just couldn't be happier with our stay. My wife is a designer and certified clean freak and she commented several times how super clean and wonderfully decorated this cute little place was ( I agree wholeheartedly). You'll be staying in the bottom level of a single-family, owner-occupied home. The numerous windows are positioned so you get are perfect view of the sunrise as well as the sunset. The rooms include a large bedroom with queen size bed, a large bathroom with shower, large-enough, well-equipped kitchen, and a large living room. More than enough room for 2 adults. The views are incredible ( while the pics on airbnb are nice, they do not come close to how beautiful the view actually is). 
You are less than 1 mile from the pacific coast highway and 2 minutes from El Matador beach park- beautiful ! 2 minutes away from a shopping area with grocery store. The hosts- Larry and Nancy could be more gracious. Ready to help with anything, yet invisible the entire stay. We'd stay again in a heartbeat.
********** po

The experience was fantastic. Larry and Nancy (and Daisy) were so friendly and helpful. The space is great, very quiet and peaceful, beautiful views and close to the beaches. The beaches are mostly locals, so they are not overpopulated and they are calm and relaxing. We did laundry everyday which helped us reduce what we needed to bring with us. We drove to LA (1 hour), Newport Beach (1 hr, 45 mins) Santa Monica (25mins) and Malibu (5 mins). We would have liked to stay longer, like forever! The trip was great and everything was as it was described. We will definitely go back to Deja Bu!
********** po

Our family enjoy staying in Larry and Nancy's house that regret not to plan longer. The scenery is more than appeared in the pictures, esp. in the morning and dawn sunshine. The kind couples provide us everything we need while leaving enough privacy to our own. Next time we are here to take surfing lesson, for sure will stay more days in this lovely house.
********** po

Our host welcomed us and kindly explained all we can use in his house. Housing was well described. Neighbors were nice and even proposed to help us. The house is 5/10 minutes drive from supermarkets. Convenient, close to centers of tourist interest (Hollywood, Universal Studios, Beverly Hills)
********** po

House exactly as described. Dean is an excellent host. Description of home is perfect, house is charming. Quiet neighborhood, and house is fantastic. Especially liked the back porch, beautiful place to relax and enjoy cool breezes. Highly recommended.
********** po

This was my second stay at Dean's place - a great house in a convenient neighborhood! I highly recommend staying here...a real home away from home.
********** po

We spent 3 nights in Dean's house with our parents. It was spacious, great, relaxed experience like at home for us (and great American home experience for our parents from Japan!) Soon after open the gate, there is a small fountain pond with goldfish, it was so nice to listen to the water sound and fun for feeding goldfish! The six-burner gas range in the kitchen was nice, easy and fun to cook. We enjpoyed the breakfast on the outside deck, it was peaceful and full of pleasure. Dean was a wonderful host. When we checked in, he welcomed us with delicious caramel candies from nearby cafe and gave us a quick tour in the house. He gave us good recommendation of cafe for brunch in neighborhood. We enjoyed talking with him very much. His communication after cheking in was also friendly and quick for our small questions by text. We really appreciate for this stay. 
********** po

From our first communication up until our stay, Dean was communicative and accommodating. He took time to greet us and show us around his beautiful home. I highly recommend both the house and the location. Within minutes you can find yourself in downtown Pasadena without having to join the chaos of the LA freeway system. That said, you feel as if you are in a secluded, quiet haven completely removed from any city hustle and bustle. We enjoyed walking and running in the beautiful surrounding neighborhood, we slept soundly on comfortable beds in the quietest of surroundings, and were surprised to find ourselves feeling very relaxed during a busy business trip. I would definitely return and highly recommend this gorgeous home to anyone planning to visit the area. 
********** po

Dean was extremely responsive to every email. The house was clean and was as advertised. It was an 8 minute drive from the house to old town pasadena which was convenient. The two decks in the back were large and had a nice view. It is worth noting that one of the bedrooms is accessed via the back deck but it has its own bathroom.
********** po

We had a lovely stay! It was very comfortable , clean, and conveniently located. And ,Dean was a delight to communicate with. thanks again,Dean!
********** po

The neighborhood was very quiet and beautiful. The home was quaint and comfortable. We loved the jacuzzi, beautiful pond and rock garden in the front of house. We had a great stay and would definitely return, if we were in the area again. Dean was great host!
********** po

Dean was very attentive and responded to questions promptly, overall he was a great host. The house was beautiful in a quiet and relaxing neighbourhood and was exactly as advertised in the photos. Close in proximity to several major freeways making it easy to get around LA which was a big plus for our family in town looking to see the sights. We highly recommend this property and host to anyone looking 
********** po

My sisters and I stayed at Dean's place during the New Year's holiday. It is charming, comfortable, clean, relaxing and secure. It is close to so many attractions in the LA area too. Dean was very accommodating and a wonderful host. I would highly recommend his place to anyone visiting the LA area.
********** po

The home was exactly as described and was PERFECT for our stay! Close to so many things in LA. The ability to park two cars in the drive-way was fantastic since parking was usually hard to come by on the street. We never met Dalia in person but she was great in all our correspondence with her. The shower just off the dining room area was AMAZING! HUGE shower with tile, glass doors, etc. The backyard area was fantastic with a patio table, chairs, etc. There were 6 of us that stayed here and we spent time just relaxing in the backyard also. Do not hesitate to stay here! You will be glad you did!
********** po

Great time. The house offered everything we needed. I made arrangements for my family and no one was disappointed. Thank you so much for a wonderful Airbnb experience.
********** po

Dalia's place was great! Perfect for what we needed, location, size, clean, it was just what we wanted. Would absolutely stay there again! 
********** po

Communication was smooth. Check in and check out was easy. Everything was as indicated in the listing. Very comfortable for a family of four. All necessary cooking implements were provided, and the grill and outdoor eating area were welcome pluses. The location provides extremely convenient access to westside LA. Despite being near to a busy street (Overland), it was *very quiet* at night with the windows closed.
********** po

Dalia is a great host, we like the house very much. Everything is the same as on the pictures. We will definitely stay there again when we are in LA.
********** po

The home was wonderful. Lots of space, great location, nicely decorated. I'm so glad 4 if us were able to hang out together - much better than several small hotel rooms!
********** po

Perfect stay. Beautiful house and well located. Very close to the beach and freeways in a quiet neighborhood.
********** po

One of the best places we booked in airbnb. Very clean, very responsive host, very good location, host attention to details is excellent.
********** po

We were flying into Los angeles for a week long event so we picked this place. We had a special situation where one of our friends had to come earlier before check in, just a couple hours due to her flight landing earlier. One call to Dalia and she was extremely understanding about it. She welcomed us in, the house was beautiful and also a spacious backyard, more than I was expecting so that was a nice bonus. Would definitely stay here again if given the chance.
********** po

Dalia's house was very comfortable to stay at. No complaints at all, I would highly recommend it to anyone!
********** po

The pictures looks exactly how the place is- clean, comfortable and super cute! My 2 friends and I stayed here for about 5 days and it was perfect for us. The location is great, right by Venice beach, Abbot Kinney and Washington Blvd. All with great options for food, beer and hang out spots. Venice beach is 15 minute walk and always fun to just spend the day there.The home is located in the Venice Canals neighborhood and its a quiet area which is so nice for those who want that relaxed and safe feeling. The canals were beautiful and it was great to walk through them, many great opportunities for pictures. Hamid was an amazing host! Very accommodating and attentive. He provided us with all the essentials: towels, toothbrushes, razors, soaps, and even provided a case of water bottles. He was very quick to respond as well with any questions we had and even brought over more stuff if needed. My friends and I really enjoyed our stay at this cute home. It was like having a private apt as its all yours to use. The privacy of your own home but with the great host to make the stay perfect. We will most likely stay here again!
********** po

Hamid has created a lovely cottage in a great position in the Venice canal area close to beach and great cafes. The cottage is newly remodeled and well appointed and he included lots of little things like great coffee, bottled water and other amenities. The bed is fantastic- had the best sleep after a very long flight. Many thanks Hamid. Would love to go here again.
********** po

Hamid was a very gracious host. We booked his apartment along the Venice Canals while spending a weekend in Venice Beach in mid-June. It was perfect - just what we were looking for. Quaint, modern and beachy. And there was street parking nearby - a definite plus if you're renting a car to get around town or to drive about 20 minutes to LAX. Hamid is an architect and has recently renovated the apartment. You can definitely see his attention to detail. He lives in a residence next door on the Canal and is very accessible should you need anything at all. Otherwise, he treats you like you're at your own little home while staying there (even with some welcoming coffee and beer - two essentials)! We would definitely recommend the apartment for those looking for a simple, modern aesthetic and convenience to all the main Venice Beach attractions.
********** po

Great little house and an unbeatable location. Hamid was very nice, but unfortunately the place was not as described. It had not been cleaned - dirty dishes, dirty floors, dusty. Also, we specifically booked (and paid more for) a place with a full kitchen. I texted Hamid on day 2 of our 10 day stay that our stove was broken and he said he would fix it. By day 4 I hadn't heard from him and when I reached out, he told me the stove could not be fixed. We were extremely disappointed and consequently had to eat out for every meal instead of cooking a few meals at home. 
********** ng

Hamid is a wonderful and a very accommodating host! Made us feel at home immediately upon arrival. Great location and beautiful home. We highly recommended this place! Jacqueline and Derrick 
********** po

Hamid was a really super friendly and great host. The location of the house is superb and walking distance to attractive places. The house is just like in the pictures. I would for sure recommend this house.
********** po

Great location - only a few blocks from the beach and right on the Venice canals. The listing is exactly as described and Hamid puts extra the effort in to make you feel at home. The one thing I would call out though is that it gets really hot in the place even with the air conditioner and ceiling fans on full blast. Otherwise, we had an amazing stay.
********** nt

Hamid's place is very comfortable and in a perfect location. Highly recommend!
********** po

Our stay was quite pleasant because the host was very kind, helpful and responsive to our needs. Furthermore, the place was in the perfect location on the canals and walkable distance to the Venice beach. The house had all the heating and cooling amenities needed. Overall, it was a great Airbnb experience because the host offer amazing hospitality. I would definitely return and stay there again.
********** po

My boyfriend and I had the absolute pleasure of staying at Hamid's for three months. The place was so cute and perfect for two. The location was impeccable. I loved my morning walks on the Canals, they are filled with unique houses and beautiful flowers, and very peaceful. And then a few blocks away - you have the Venice pier and boardwalk. In the other direction, you have Abbot Kinney with many shops, bars, and restaurants. There's a really cute French Cafe we walked to regularly. We found a few spots we regularly visited. The Venice and Marina del Rey area have so much to offer without having to travel into LA. So many things to do in walking distance. Santa Monica is a cheap Uber drive away! We did visit a few comedy clubs at night, which were only about 25 minutes drive. Manhattan Beach was a nice beach bike ride away as well. The place itself was very well equipped with anything you would need. Having a kitchen was huge! The place was clean, warm, and inviting. We stayed for an extended time and it truly felt like home. This is a beautiful, safe, quiet area of Venice. Communicating with Hamid was very easy and he was always quick to respond. We really are so thankful for him and this place. We couldn't have had a better experience and a better host. Hamid was so kind and the place was fantastic. This place is in such a wonderful location. The canals are one of a kind. And being able to walk to the pier and watch the sunset was pretty unreal. It was so hard to leave. We definitely recommend staying here! : )
********** po

Convenient place off of Hollywood Blvd. We had a great time staying here. Would recommend if you just need a place to sleep after a long day of exploring LA!
********** po

Awesome location when visiting LA! Super close to Universal Studios and walking distance to Walk of Fame. Def best place to stay at! Coming back again!
********** po

Everything was clear and fine.

********** po
This studio is perfect for anyone who wants to explore Hollywood. You're literally around the corner from Hollywood Blvd and the Walk of Fame, also the place where many tours depart. The place was clean, the bed very comfortable, and the kitchen had everything we needed. It's a lovely, quiet complex and we never even heard the neighbors. The AC is a mobile unit so it wasn't super cold inside but that didn't bother us at all. It cooled off enough at night to sleep. We met the host and she was super nice and friendly. Highly recommended!
********** po

This was the perfect spot for wanting to tour Hollywood Blvd. Almost everything we had planned was in walking distance.
********** po

Nice location, looks like the photos. The host was helpful. It can be a bit noisy at night as it’s s front unit facing the street. Very convenient only few minutes walk to Hollywood boulevard.
********** nt

This appartment in the heart of Hollywood is perfect! It is clean, big and comfortable. But the best part is the location, just around the corner of the walk of fame. We had an excellent stay, thanks for that!
********** po

Anita is so sweet and easily reachable whenever you need her. The apartment itself is accurate and clean; lots of space especially in the LA area. Though it’s kind of easy to miss the place at first glance. If you’re bringing a car, just a heads up that it is a narrow pathway to the parking lot, but other wise this place is a great spot! Would definitely book here again.
********** po

Great location if Hollywood is where you want to be. Everything is right around the corner. Apartment seems bigger in person than in the pictures. Easy to find. Bed was a bit too soft for me but that’s personal preference. Really enjoyed our stay.
********** po

The place is clean, tidy and comfortable. We really enjoy the stay.
********** po

Dough was very pleasant and welcoming host. The house was beautifully decorated and perfect for our needs. All the facilities were provided. Though we stayed there for only one night, but would definitely stay there again in future. I would highly recommend this place. P.S.

Doug is an amazing host! We really enjoyed staying with him. I will definitely stay with him again when I am in town. I can highly recommend Dougs place!

Loved my stay!! Easy freeway access, yet super quiet, even sitting at backyard patio with laptop. Doug communicates very clearly on logistics and a superb host. The backyard is very well kept up and even though I didn't get to jump into the pool, it was warm and newly built so very inviting. Everything is new inside the (Website hidden by Airbnb) 're welcomed with water, fruits, and snacks. Peaceful oasis in the middle of South Bay.

Doug was an excellent host. He was very welcoming and helpful. The description is very accurate and the room is very comfortable with access to a beautiful patio and to the swimming pool. Couldn't have asked for more.
********** po

Our stay with Doug was wonderful. His home was beautiful and he is beyond friendly. Next time I'm in town, we're booking with him again!
********** po

The flat was bright, comfortable and clean and Adriano was pleasant and gracious about accommodating us at the last minute. The Brixton tube was a very short walk away and there were plenty of buses. There are lots of fast food restaurants, banks, and shops along the main street.
********** po

We stayed with Adriano and Valerio for a week when first moving to London. The apartment is great and very clean compared to a lot of places we've seen in London. Situated very close to Brixton tube and good bus links to central London. Thanks guys!
********** po

Adriano was a fantastic host. We felt very at home while staying there. Our first morning we woke up and saw the dining table set for breakfast which was much appreciated. His flat is conveniently located a block from the tube station, with a number of shops and restaurants in the area as well. His place was very clean and tidy, overall just a fantastic experience. 
********** po

We had a most wonderful stay with Adriano and Valerio. They are both interesting and interested hosts who serve a delicious cappuccino with breakfast in the morninig. Their place is small but clean and comfy. Central London is a short bus or tube ride ... very convenient. We look forward to returning to London and staying with them again.
********** po

 I'm not sure which of us misunderstood the situation, but I was not aware that Adriano and his cousin would be in residence...I thought I was renting the apartment to myself. Nonetheless, he was a very gracious host. The neighborhood is not a good one, and anyone renting here should be aware of that. I would not walk in that area at night under any circumstances. The apartment is spotlessly clean though. 
********** nt

This is a great place to stay! Adriano and Valerio are wonderful hosts, super friendly, welcoming, and respectful. Valerio is the perfect guy to talk to and make you feel welcome in a warm home environment. The bedroom is very comfortable, my mom and I stayed with them for a few days and felt like home. The bathroom and flat were very clean :) The location has close access to the tube station and many buses, food stores, and ATMs. Valerio kindly prepared coffee and set breakfast for us every day :) Adriano is very knowledgeable of the city and places you should visit and ways to get there. He advised us on places to go, sights, and everything. Thanks for being so nice guys! If I ever go back to London this will definitely be the place I hope to stay.
********** po

the place is in a quiet side road, very convenient (a 2 minute slow walk) to the tube on Victoria line. The room is a bit small but very comfortable, clean and well organized, including wireless internet! The bathroom is spacious and clean. Adriano is a wonderful host, very kind and ready to help. Also he prepares a fantastic cappuccino at breakfast! My daughter and I felt this was a great place, we stayed there 3 nights and felt safe and welcomed. We warmly recommend Adriano's place. Grazie Adriano e ciao! Giusi & Elena 
********** po

The room was as shown. Didn't have access to the living room much. I'd pick another place to stay closer to downtown I think next time. London was a great experience.
********** ng

I had a great stay with Adriano! He was very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. The flat was clean, and the room was very nice. The area/neighbourhood is very multicultural - making it interesting yet safe. I had no problems going there alone at night, and neither should anyone else, provided they don't mind the smells and sounds from the big Afro-Caribbean community - which is far more exciting than the blandness of the regular tourist places. 
********** po

adriano is a sweet and totally gentle guy. his house is tiny, but SUPER clean and cozy--he keeps his bathroom cleaner than any hotel i have ever been in! the bed is very comfortable with a really nice comforter, his cappuccino is excellent, and the conversation is interesting and friendly. the house is all the way at the end of the victoria line, but it's a really easy ride from central london and only a two block walk from the tube stop. he really goes out of his way to make you feel welcome and comfortable. i would stay there again, without hesitation. 
********** po

Alina was a really good host. The flat is clean and tidy - and really close to Finsbury Park station which is quite close to Central London. I recommend Alina to everyone.
********** po

Alina is an amazing host. She made me feel right at home. It was more like hanging out with a friend than a complete stranger. She's very sweet and makes a mean espresso. There are tons of places right around flat to eat and market is close in case you want to cook. I would definitely stay here again if I was in London. Thanks Alina you're awesome.
********** po

Alina's place is so nice, the room is big and clean, and the bed is huge. Alina is a great host, and she made sure I had everything I needed, for instance she had put clean towels on the bed for me:) I felt very at home in her place. Aside from that she really helped me out with a lot of things, and even helped me find a permanent place to live in London. So overall a great place to stay with a great girl.
********** po

Nice location in Islington area, good for short business trip. House is OK, host is very friendly.
********** po

I'm very happy to have been Alina's guest! We've had great time in London and enjoyed our stay. Alina is a great host, we felt us so welcomed by her! Alina's house location is very convenient, it's only 5 min walk to Finsbury Park tube station and also a direct (Picadilly) line to Heathrow Airport (in case yu have an early departure you can use the opportunity to sleep a bit in the train :) The flat itself is very nice and clean and comfortable, especially the double-bed with new mattress, I slept like a newborn :) And also the red sofa on the small roof terrace is great, I enjoyed the last night London sky! To all who is going to visit London I highly reccomend Alina and her beautiful house to stay in. Alina, thank you so much and I hope to see you one day again!
********** po

I stayed with Alina in her flat in London for a week. It's a wonderful home with a warm feeling and everything you need. Alina went out of her way to make sure I was comfortable and we shared some great chats and meals. I recommend Alina's place to anyone looking for a home for a while in London, and look forward to seeing Alina again. 
********** po

Alina was a perfect guest and her flat is absolutely wonderful. Highly recommended.

The House is a piece of Art , there are beautiful portraits everywhere , so close to the tube station , on piccaddily and Victoria lines , the host alina is very friendly , welcoming , and polite person , highly recommended

We loved staying at Phillipa's place in Chelsea. The flat was lovely, and the neighborhood was great. Lots of fun shops, and close to two metro stops. We would love to stay there again!
********** po

A comfortable apartment conveniently located near shops, restaurants and tube stations. Philippa is a very helpful and friendly hostess. We would recommend her and her apartment to anyone. Thank you Philippa for an enjoyable holiday.
********** po

I really enjoyed my week at Philippa's, the place is ideally situated in Chelsea, and she is a very kind host, I would definitely recommend that you stay there, I will again without any doubt. 
********** po

I am a little late reviewing this but it is important to me that I do. Look, the place is in a great location and the neighbor was very friendly. The place was perfectly comfortable and Philippa gave a lot of helpful information prior to our arrival in England. However, me and my girlfriend were robbed the second night we were there. We went out to meet friends and by the time we got back, all of our valuables were taken (computers, iPods, camera equipment, jewelry, etc). It was upon the arrival of the police that we learned two things: 1) Rooms here are rented out very, very frequently. There are always people in and out so it is very obvious that there are tourists coming in and out of here. 2) The locks, as explained by the police, are very inadequate at this location and can be circumvented with extremely simple tactics. The most aggravating part of this was how we were treated. We followed all instructions exactly as they were laid out and were very deliberate in making sure everything was perfectly secure as we went in and out of the place. However, all correspondence with Philippa (through email or through her neighbor) indicated nothing other than it somehow being our fault. There was very little sympathy and all the commentary centered around what WE did. Additionally, Philippa basically just stopped replying to emails after we expressed how frustrated we were from her responses and the lack of security and safety in the building. So, it is a nice place and a convenient location, but the threat of robbery (or God forbid attacks) is just simply too high here.
********** ng

Very nice flat, and extremely well-located. Great for couples and single travelers. It is small and notes in the lobby indicate that the neighbors don't take kindly to noise--if you are a large family or group, this is probably not the place for you. Philippa herself was a great host--I very much enjoyed meeting her. She left a great selection of helpful tourist info. 
********** nt

This is a superior option to staying at a hotel in London, especially when considering the price of London hotels. The place is located in lovely Chelsea, seconds away from scores of shops, restaurants and pubs. There is also a supermarket and cinema literally right around the corner. If your only in London a few days and are primarily sight-seeing, the place is within walking distance to two metro stations and two or three tube stops to Westminister, Soho and Southbank (about 20 mins total time).  A really great option for quick and easy access to central London with a quieter, trendy and less tourist neighbourhood to come home too. And for anyone traveling from North America, London public transit is an absolute dream in comparison. The apartment itself is very cute, perfectly clean and very well out-fitted. Everything was recieved exactly as promised in the ad. Phillipa was a kind and helpful host. We would definitely recommend this place. Great visit!
********** po

Located in a convenient and central area of London, this flat is the perfect place for tourists looking for an affordable home base. Close to 2 tube stops and several bus lines, the flat is close to great shops and in a nice residential area. You'll have to be respectful of your neighbors if coming in late at night or early in the morning but it also means a peaceful time for yourself. The amenities and apartment are just as the photos and description indicate. The host is very helpful and accommodating. I'd love to stay here again on a return trip to London! 
********** po

Delightful, charming hostess. Very clean, and wonderful neighborhood. Only one bus to the city, lots of amenities nearby, very safe area, great pubs nearby, went for evening walks, great coffee shop in the morning....Thanks Philippa!
********** po

Philippa is a wonderful host and a most charming woman - the apartment was lovely, the location perfect, the stay was completely hassle and problem free and I look forward to returning as soon as I can.
********** po

I enjoyed my stay at Phillipa's apartment. It was within easy walking distance to the underground station and was in an attractive and upmarket part of London. It was a bonus having Waitrose supermarket in the next street. Although I didn't get to meet Phillipa ( she was overseas) I had regular contact with her and she was concerned that I had a pleasant stay and everything I needed. I would recommend the apartment for both a long or short term stay in London. Melanie Brown
********** po

Amazing location - great apartment, plenty of room for 4 - with space for more. Well appointed rooms. Easy to get to. A great stay.
********** po

Great place. Less than a 5 minute walk to Warren Street Tube Station, and buses to Piccadilly Circus, Charing Cross/Trafalgar Square, King's Cross/St. Pancras. Clean, safe neighborhood with restaurants and pubs steps away. A Tesco, Sainsbury and Pret a Manger are really close. 3 bds and 2 bthrm were enough to comfortably house 6 adults. Full kitchen, dish washer, and washing machine were a plus. No complaints. Would stay here again. Thanks Liz.
********** po

The apartment was very clean, easy to use and was a great temporary home for us. We stayed here for 9 days as we did some day trips out to various other cities across the UK. The location is absolutely fabulous. It is within walking distance of at least 5 different tube lines and two national rail stations, so day trips are super easy. There are a host of restaurants, pubs, grocery stores, etc. in easy walking distance. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone!********** po

Liz was really great to accomodate our need for an apt. only ONE day before we were leaving for London. The apt. is very cute. Liz left really detailed information about the apt. and was available in case we needed anything. We love the neighborhood (walking distance to Soho/West End) and it was perfect for our needs.
********** po

Everything was perfect. I woud recommend this flat.
********** po

The location is perfect and the flat is very nice for 3 couples. Nice place to spend a good week-end or holidays in London. Enjoy
********** po

Perfect location - perfect flat! Couldn't get any better! Really enjoyed our stay and hope to be back soon!
********** po

The apartment was in a great central location for the Olympics and very close to the underground and restaurants. It was a clean (except for some silver fish in one of the bathrooms) and comfortable apartment. I was not happy with the number of bathroom towels provided. There were 5 of us so we were given 5 bath towels, 2 hand towels and no wash clothes. We were there for 9 days and the washing machine broke early in our stay. Our towels got a little ripe by the end or our stay. Liz was responsive when we emailed her, but I would have liked better communication on confirming our stay as it got closer. We paid for the flat 6 months in advance because it was for the Olympics so I started to get worried when I did not hear from her. I finally emailed her just over a week before we were to arrive to confirm our stay and find out how we were to access the flat. When she responded, she confirmed the place but said nothing about accessing it. Finally a day before we were to arrive she emailed the access info. Lastly, The second day we were there the washing/dryer machine jammed and would not open. Liz sent someone out to fix it and told us it was a broken handle, but didn't let us know it wouldn't be fixed until after we were gone. We found this out only after sending an inquiring email. She never once talked with us about paying for the repair. When we got home we received an email from an Airbnb mediator to pay for the repair.  Through Airbnb we came to a compromise and paid half of the repair though we did not break the handle. Liz is responsive and nice, but often does not initiate communication when it would be appropriate and helpful. 
********** ng

Great and clean place if you need a central location in London. Great if you have couples (2 queen beds), and big and equiped kitchen. Nice place if you enjoy restaurants and pubs in central London. Jack and Liz were great hosts - everything work perfectly.
********** po

A cozy and lovely flat in a great location. No surprises from the posting, and the owner was very responsive with questions or needs.
********** po

The communication with Joe was very easy. We received accurate direction upon arrival and Joe made us feel welcome before we met. We stayed for three nights and we would definitely come again. The location is easy to reach via TFL and the area offers a different view from the other side of the river Thames. We even managed to go for a run in Battersea Park. Great! The two owners are very nice and make you feel very welcome. The beautiful house with its stylish and well chosen interior gives a warm comfort. We can really recommend this place. It is a very good alternative to main stream locations and it instantly becomes your little home in this amazing city.
********** po

We loved staying in Joe Chen's house. It's very comfortable, well organized, stylish and clean and we felt at home from the very first day. Joe and Paolo are lovely hosts who did everything to make us feel welcome. Battersea Park close by was so beautiful! Ideal for long walks. We would love to stay at theirs again! 
********** po

Joe's placde in Battersea is fabulous. Dealing with Joe was delightul; he was very helpful and accommodating and very accessible and easy to communicate with. His house is very comfortable, he left very thorough and informative instructions and information. Without ever meeting him, he made me feel right at home. I highly recommend his house to anyone looking for a home away from home. His well supplied kitchen makes it easy to prepare your own meals. For those wanting to go out to eat, there are many wonderful restaurants within walking distances. A short bus ride from King's Road or the underground, makes it an ideal location. We had a great time in London thanks to Joe.
********** po

We had a great stay in this house, well located in Battersea, perfectly served by several bus lines, with a very short trip to reach Sloane Square, South Kensington or Victoria Station. The house is warm and pleasant, full of art pieces and smartly furnished, with a beautiful kitchen perfectly equipped. We were two adults with two boys and one 2-years-old child, it was very confortable for us. We hadn’t the opportunity to meet the owner but we received by him all the information we needed in a very complete, effective and friendly way. 
********** po

Beautiful, clean house in a super location. Joe was very helpful. Great trip. Will stay again!
********** po

My Aussie family was in London for my sister's wedding and found a second home at Joe and Pablo's house. The house was perfect for recovering from long journeys and catching up. We loved the details of the house - architectural features, glass floors and many paintings, as well as cooking up a storm in the well equipped kitchen. The common garden was idyllic. Overall, we felt very lucky to be able to stay at Joe and Pablo’s house. The house is in a great location. Given the amount of space and proximity to Piccadilly tube line - its a great deal. A zipcar is also just around the corner, which we made use of during our stay. 
********** po

We 3 stayed as a familiy for 8 days at Joe's home. The house is very clean and functional, instructions clear and complete. Good location and connections. I loved the aesthetic sensibility of their interior design. Ability in combining elements with dfferent caracter and history, art all over the place creates a subtile tension, vibrant, inspiring and multicultural at the same time. We felt at home. Joe let us discover places we loved and would not have discovered ourselves. We felt a bit like locals. thks will come again!

********** po

Joe's home is beautiful and very well equiped. Angelina was there at the agreed time and assisted with a query during our stay, immediately and very professionally. The bed in the main bedroon is one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in. it took us a while to get orientated regarding public transport in the area, but bus 319 to Sloan Square is a win. It was a great experience. Thank you Joe.
********** po

We really enjoyed our stay in Joe's flat in Battersea. The location is very good. Easy buses just outside into central London (including late-night), and only a 20 minute walk to Clapham Junction with connections to everywhere. The flat is so so lovely - really well designed, beautiful light, we were very impressed with the layout. The two bedrooms are far away from each other to provide good privacy. There is some adult-only artwork in the flat, which struck us as a bit odd for an airbnb property. Also, there is some major construction going on next door which woke us up some mornings. Overall, very happy with Joe's flat
********** nt

Wonderful house, nice place and tidy with reliable owners. Joe and Paul cared all things we needed. Good accessibility having regard to the price. recommend. (group of 6 university teachers)
********** po

We were very happy to have been able to stay at Joe's home during our recent visit to London. The house is exactly as it appears in the photos. The decor is amazing with fantastic touches everywhere! The kitchen is extremely well-equipped, rooms are all of a good size & the beds are very comfortable - linens exceptional!!! Through the back door is a large communal green area that can only be accessed by the residents of the homes that back onto it. It's lovely and lush and because this house is the end terrace unit, the patio still has a feeling of privacy - very nice! The home is full of wonderful art and and you must really take the time to notice all the little details - delightful surprises abound. We cannot recommend this property highly enough. We loved it all! Thank you Joe.  
********** po

Amazing! I felt at home as soon as I walked through the door. The bus stop is really close by so transportation was a breeze. The kitchen is wonderful and I have to ask him where he got the matress and pillows because they were beyond comfortable. I would say everyone should stay here. When I go back to London there is no place I'd rather be.
********** po

Very well-kept flat with nice communal back garden.
********** po

What a pleasant house in a very convenient location! The stay was most enjoyable and the house was immaculate, well designed and full of interesting artwork and literature. I highly recommend!
********** po

It really is as awesome as the pictures! The house is amazing – beautiful, great light, spacious and clean. The artwork and wonderfully decorated interior make it comfortable and inspiring. The location is perfect with a nice Italian coffee shop around the corner and close to public transportation making it easy to get around. Joe is an excellent host as he is extremely friendly, helpful and a great communicator! He provided a thoughtful printed guide to the flat. His wonderful recommendations and tips helped us as we adjusted to London. We loved every minute of our stay and would recommend Joe’s place. It exceeded all expectations.
********** po

My four friends and I rented this house for over a week and it was absolutely perfect for our first time in London. The location is very good (a little out of the city), and we had no issues at all getting into London and even to attractions outside of London via bus, subway and taxi. The house itself is wonderful- very clean and stocked with all the essentials (plenty of clean towels, kitchenware, etc). The decor is very fun and fresh, we instantly felt very much at home. Joe is an excellent communicator. He responds quickly and provided us with detailed and comprehensive guides for the house and the local neighborhood. I would definitely recommend Joe to my friends and other Airbnb users! 
********** po

We had a very pleasant stay at Joe's house. It has an excellent location, 2 minutes walk to the bus stop and 15 minutes to the subway station, close to many restaurants and pubs. The house is very clean, spacious and comfortable, has a fully equipped kitchen, a charming backyard and is artistically vibrant decorated.We got great advice from Joe regarding public transportation connections and the neighborhood. Overall, our London vacation was even more enjoyable thanks to this house and its owner.
********** po

Nice, modern house with charming private communal court/garden in typical London neighbourhood. Tasteful and well-equipped. You can see the owner loves his house and right he is.  
********** po

My family and I had a great week in Joe's house, which is situated in a quiet neighborhood, 2 min. walk from bus transport and 15 min to the nearest over ground station (Clapham Junction). If you enjoy jogging or a walk in the park, Battersea park is only 5 minutes jog away (a 5 km round trip). I never met Joe in person, but he was very informative and helpful in the booking process and the detailed informative instruction for the house that he emailed (Website hidden by Airbnb)

A great house, comfortable stay, excellent communication with the host. It was easy to access the property. It was in a really good location. The house was clean and had everything you could need. Thanks for a great stay!

Lovey flat and very well equipped throughout . Nice and light but only single glazed so could be cold in winter. Amanda is very kind and helpful.
********** nt

This was a lovely place to stay. The flat was beautiful, in a quiet location with great access to transport and amenities. Amanda was a great host right from the initial contact and very helpful throughout our stay, even when we had to make changes to our booking. Check in and check out was very easy. I would recommend this place to all. 
********** po

What can I say? This is by far the best apartment that I have stayed in over the last few years. Amanda was a wonderful host and replied to the few queries I had quickly. The apartment was wonderful and very clean. I knew as soon as I walked in that it was a home rather than just a holiday let. Thanks Amanda! I'll definitely be booking again!
********** po

We've spent a fortnight in this great apartment and have already booked to return. Great, easily accessible location near the common and really well appointed, comfortable, spacious flat. Amanda is a fantastic host. Always easy to get hold of her, responds wuickly and is very accommodating. Highly recommended - thank you Amanda, looking forward to our return.
********** po

Another fantastic stay at Amanda's lovely, spacious, comfortable apartment. Such a convenient location, with great amenities nearby. The parking space is a great bonus for us too. Thank you so much for having us - we'll be back again soon!
********** po

Staying with Amanda was an excellent experience. The flat was comfortable, incredibly well fitted out, convenient to transport and shops and had a lovely ambience. I did a lot of cooking and the kitchen was superb. Lovely outlook to trees and I walked each morning in the Wimbledon Common. Bus was right outside of the apartment complex and 2 convenience stores across the road were very well stocked. I could not have been happier with this experience and Amanda was a gracious and helpful host from start to finish. Highly recommended !
********** po

This a very comfortable flat and we enjoyed our stay.
********** po

Listing is accurate, location is nice and green with many trees just outside the windows. Kitchen is small, but well stocked and functional. Bathroom is great - lots of shelf space and racks to accommodate 3-4 people's toiletries and towels. Beds were very comfortable, unfortunately the sofa was not, but we sat on cushions and it was OK. The entire flat felt welcoming and happy, and the location worked well - great access to the Wimbledon Common (local park) for running/exercise. 
********** po

Agnes was there waiting for us and did a wonderful explanation of the facilities .

Amanda is a superior host. She communicates. Fixes things immediately. Doesn't make you feel guilty for asking. Etc. We have no complaints. This place is exactly as advertised.

10,000 times better and cheaper than staying at a hotel! The house is immaculate, very spacious and very well decorated and all the furniture is brand new. It's very quiet outside so you can sleep soundly...Grace is a wonderful host who really makes sure your stay is comfortable and the best ever...and a wonderful cook too...her dishes are delicious! Location is perfect...5 min walk from huge 24 hrs Tesco, tube station 2 min walk, High Street 3 min walk and Brent Cross Shopping Mall is around 7 min walk.
********** po

Grace's house is so clean! It's probably the cleanest I have ever seen. The room is super comfy and rather roomy. She's a great host.
********** po

Even though this review is late.. I would not miss giving it for the world. Stuart and I were plannin gour move to London from Wales and looking for properties over one weekend, decided to look at airbnb. True to the past reviews Grace has recieved, she is prompt in getting back in touch with you. In my case at 11.45pm so that we could be confirmed for the next evening. She is a fantastic hostess with a home thats as warm as her. She welcomed us with open arms and an open heart and never made us feel like guests. Grace was a pleasure... is every possible way. And I will recommend her hands down. Anytime!!
********** po

Grace G is awesome, very courteous and friendly in person. She offers great hospitality which I appreciate. Her home is modern, well-maintained, clean and comfortable. The location is at a quiet and nice suburban neighborhood within walking distance to tube station. The house is equipped with WIFI internet, which is convenient to use with notebook. Besides fresh linen and towel, she also provides breakfast. The kitchen is stocked with grocery items which guests can help themselves with. Overall I have a pleasant stay.
********** po

Grace G is a lovely, friendly and thoughtful person. Our room was quite adequate and overlooked the garden. The neighborhood is a very interesting mix of Hasidic Jews and Asians. Breakfast provisions were excellent-exotic yogurt flavors we cannot get in the U.S. Grace was kind enough to leave an umbrella at our door on a day that looked like it might rain and she served as our alarm clock one morning when we had to rise at 5:30AM. The closest tube is Brent Cross-a brisk 10 minute walk. We would highly recommend staying with Grace G. Marian & Russell
********** po

I'm so glad I decided to stay at Grace's place. It's so comfortable, clean, and pretty. Everything I needed was there. The neighborhood is great and I had a wonderful time walking through it and seeing the local shops. Grocery stores and public transportation are very easy to get to. Grace herself is the perfect host, very generous and a gracious person. I really hope I can meet Grace again and perhaps offer her the same hospitality she offered me. Thank you so much Grace!!
********** po

What can I say about Grace that isn't already said? She's wonderful; I would definitely stay here again!
********** po

Grace's house is the first Airbnb experience for my girlfriend's parents. Thus, in the first place, I really hope it would be a wonderful experience - I am not glad the parents like the experience. Moreover, the house is very clean, well-arranged and welcoming. Grace herself is very friendly, kind and respectful. I highly recommend this apartment to other travelers. 
********** po

Grace is so kind, I decided the best idea was to just stay with her more nights!
********** po

Grace couldn't get rid of me!! I just kept adding days, but she was very gracious and accepted my requests to extend my visit. Thank you!!

Very quiet and comfortable stay, great host. Thanks

I wish i could move in with Cryn! The room was spacious, bed comfortable and let's not forget the lovely host! I feel as though I was welcomed by an old friend. The garden in the back is amazing and the sweet feeling of the house made me forget about the 6 hour flight and the endless tube and train travel to get there. The house is close to the Upton Park tube station and as a football fan I was delighted the walk to the Boleyn Ground was just a few streets over. There's also plenty of pubs, eateries, and places to get everything you need. I would recommend Cryn's home to anyone!
********** po

Cryn's place is peaceful and homely. Cryn is a lovely hostess and is always willing to help but also gives you all the space and freedom you need.
********** po

Cryn was the perfect host; attentive and hospitable. She was completely flexible on my arrival time and was friendly and went out of her way to make me feel at home. I spent a very good night in her box room which I would highly recommend and would happily stay again if she would have me!
********** po

Cryn's place is a real find in London, indeed, Cryn herself is a real find. The victorian cottage with a lovely spring garden is a welcome relief from the hustle and bustle of London. well situated on the district line and so convienient for both town and docklands. As a host, Cryn made me very welcome, and a cup of tea, in her lovely country garden is just what you need. This yoga teaching- preserve- making great conversationalist was a dream host, and I'll be back.

My daughter and her friend and I all stayed at the apt owned by Gulder and her husband. They met us when we arrived and helped us find places to eat and told us good places to visit. The apt had a great view of the bridge and the river Bosphorous and although the area looked somewhat shabby it is a good neighborhood with tough rules on rebuilding. The apt is a great spot to make a base to go out from. They said they would be adding internet then it would be almost perfect. Gulder and her family have another apt just about 100 meters away and what we needed they got for us. We stayed a couple of days in center of teh old city and did the sites then worked from the apt for the remainder of our 6 days- that was a good balance we felt. Esp. if you are a larger group like 3-6 I think this is a great option as you have the whole apt and can take taxis for quite cheap to most anywhere you'd want to go- avoid the rush hour traffic though- they can tell you when is best to go which direction. Their English was great and they are actually business owners and have a son in the US at college so we felt quite comfortable and understood. We had a very nice time there.

You cannot find a better place to stay in Turkey than with Firat Basar. Imagine staying in a beautiful, airy apartment, with wall to wall windows looking out over the Bosphorus, the night skyline lighting up the whole city. The Basar family - and it is a family endeavor - are the kindest, most helpful landlords you could meet. Arda, Firat's son, not only met each member of our party as we arrived (all separately), but he brought us around town, showed us how to get around, gave recommendations on places to go, and even brought our very tired and hungry selves to his personal recommendation of a fresh, affordable seafood restaurant, and set us up with an order of traditional food with the waiters, who spoke no English (we spoke no Turkish). Close to buses, taxis, right on the water. Full kitchen facilities, near groceries, easily accommodates 3-5 people, but most importantly, fantastic, amazing landlords who will be right there for any help or need you have. Highly, highly recommended. You can't do better than Firat Basar.
********** po

I second all the excellent reviews of this place. The neighborhood where it is located has a great seaside village vibe to it with excellent seafood restaurants - I think I went to Abracadabra three times in one week. Due to the lack of an air conditioner in the apartment I wasn't able to stay the entire length of time I had originally booked - Arda was extremely cooperative and understanding and we easily negotiated a refund.
********** po

Thanks to Firat and especially Arda for their kind hospitality. Bosphorous and Breakfast is a nice place to stay for a reasonable price. The 2-bedroom apartment could easily and comfortably fit 4-5 people, though we were only 2. The neighborhood, Arnavutkoy, is quite charming, and lively but not congested. Great restaurants, grocery stores, and the Bosphous itself are all within blocks. You're just a pleasant walk from the more upscale neighborhood, Bebek, and a straightforward and cheap (1 lira) bus ride to the downtown areas. I would definitely stay in this neighborhood again. We visited Bosphorous and Breakfast in late August, so we tend to agree with other reviewers that adding an air conditioner and/or additional fans would greatly improve the level of comfort. However, we spent our days out-and-about, exploring lovely Istanbul, and the temperature of the apt was more bearable when we returned home in the evening. I think the apartment could also benefit from a more suitable dining table. A primary reason we chose airbnb over a hotel was so that we could save money by cooking and eating in from time-to-time (and we did for most breakfasts), but the table is more of a desk and not so comfortable for eating. This is just a small critique and should not sway visitors from staying here. Bosphorous and Breakfast is an accomadating and cared-for apartment, and we encourage others to book their stay here!
********** po

I really enjoyed my stay at this apartment. It was my first time using airbnb and everything was really easy. Arda is an amazing host. And, while the apartment is a bit hot, the apartment is in a really interesting neighbourhood.
********** po

Arda is a terrific host and Arnavuykoy is a charming place to stay as it is unspoiled by the rapid development found in some parts of Istanbul. Arda is quick to answer all questions very willing to make your stay pleasant.
********** po

Nice location,Mr Firat and his family are very kind,and ready to help .
********** po

My host Mr. Arda was an extremely helpful gentleman that he also helped me to carry my luggage;) House view was fantastic and as shown in the pictures. House was very well cleaned and kitchen appliances was all new and working properly. I am sure for now that it is the only place that I can feel at home in Istanbul. The apartment was in a perfect place that in the centre of the posphorus walking line. You can reach to bosphorus walking lane by walking only 200 mt. There are lots of cafes and restaurants near apartment. The area was very secure that I was alone at the apartment. Really very thanks to Arda for his kindness and hospitality.
********** po

Very nice apartment in a very nice Istanbul suburb with a view to die for! Parking can be a little problem but we managed:))) There is everything you may need at the walking distance - shops, plenty of great fish restaurants on the banks of Bosporus. Arda was very effective host, clear and prompt in communication and attentive to all the details. We felt very welcome
********** po

Arda was a great host and my stay was very pleasant.
********** po

Excellent place. While it is not in the real touristy location of Sultanahmet, that's its advantage. It's close to the metro and within 15 minutes you are at Teksim and close to everywhere. And Levent itself, where Mine's place is, is not a tourist area, and that's nice to get away from the 1,000's of tourists.
********** po

Mine is a very accommodating, helpful, and friendly hostess. The spacious, attractive, and comfortable apartment is located in a very good residential, non-touristy area, and it opens up directly onto a large tree-filled garden area, which refreshes and relaxes a person on a hot day. Two sweet cats live in the garden, so in reality in this very large city, an individual maintains contact with nature. Buses and a metro station can be found nearby; take the metro if you are worried about time and the bus if you want to know Istanbul's cityscape, but be warned that vehicular traffic can be very congested and slow. Overall, I enjoyed my stay with Mine, and based on the elements that I have mentionned, I would highly recommend this place.
********** po

Mine is a great host! She is very accommodating and helpful before I even got to Istanbul. I loved staying with her, she made my visit to Istanbul a lot more enjoyable. I totally recommend her:)
********** po

Mine was a great host! She provided helpful information about how to get to her apartment from the airport and called a taxi for me for my early morning departure from Istanbul. (Make sure you get the updated address from Mine.) The apartment is very well situated; it's a short subway ride to Taksim Square (downtown Istanbul) and also a short taxi ride to Boğaziçi University. The room is spacious, clean, and comfortable. There is a cafe up the street for breakfast if you don't have time to make tea for yourself in the morning. 
********** po

The apartment and room are great. Mine was a great and extremely solicitous host and made me feel very much at home. I can fully recommend staying there for a stay in Istanbul.
********** po

We had a great time staying with Mine. She gave excellent directions for finding her flat, which is lovely. She was very helpful with local information on transport, interesting places to visit and great places to eat and drink. Plus she is very fun and charming. Fully recommend! JGC and DQ
********** po

Mine is a very warm person who has a sense of welcome her lovely apartment is right next to a beautiful garden I had a great time with her
********** po

My stay in Istanbul was so nice, thanks to my stay at Mine's apartment! The apartment itself has lots of space, and is as described in the photos. The wifi was working perfectly, the bed was very comfortable. It is situated in an area with many shops and good restaurants, very safe, green and nice. It is very near a new metro line M6 that goes from Levent to Boğaziçi University. But that's not all, Mine is very considerate, friendly, so communicative, helpful! She made sure that I had all the information I needed, and she gave me so many useful tips. I would not hesitate a second to book again! I very highly recommend that place!
********** po

Mine's apartment was clean and very safe (there is an elaborate lock and alarm system). She made me feel extremely welcome, letting me help myself to tea, coffee and toast, and on the first evening she showed me around the local area so I knew where the metro station and bus stops were. She lent me a metro card and adaptor plug, and booked a taxi for me very early in the morning. Would definitely recommend for anyone travelling alone and wanting a quiet place to stay, with a friendly host who speaks excellent English.
********** po

Mine is super host, every minute I spent with her was lovely, she’s like my sister, taking care of me like a mother and like a professional tour guide, she gave me all the info. Valuabale and took me to places only locals know; the room is very safe and well located, you can basically jump on a bus and it will pass her house always, there’re plenty of restaurants and bars to hangout .Mine is very tidy person and room is lovely. its Very good memory to me; thank you Mine.
********** po

My friends and I stayed at Michele's apartment for about 5 days. The apartment was very nice and cozy and the location was great for exploring Istanbul. Michele was responsive to all of the emails I sent and everything went smooth. I would definitely recommend staying at her place.
********** po

We highly recommend this place! We had a pleasant stay at Michel's house. We thought it has only two ore one floor, but boom it is four floor with a very lovely and quite terrace. The house is very clean and it is close to Taksim and we reached everything easily.
********** po

This is the first time I booked an apartment using AirBNB and therefore this my first review. The apartment has a terrace that offers a stunning view on the city and the Bosphorus. It's a big plus. As Michel was abroad, Mon (Michel's assistant) helped us settle in and was very kind. The neighborhood can be a bit noisy at nigh during Ramadan but, during daytime it's pretty quiet.
********** po

We were a family party of five and stayed in Michel's apartment for three lovely nights. The location is great and Istiklal and it's neighboring lively streets, full of bars and restaurants, were a short ten minutes away by foot. The neighborhood is a safe and quiet residential area. Some of the neighboring streets are full of stairs so it may not be suitable for people that are not in best shape. The apartment was very nice, clean and well equipped and the view from the roof is breathtaking especially around the sunset. The kitchen is on the third floor so it's easy to bring your meals up to the roof and enjoy the view with dinner. The stairs inside the apartment are a bit steep, so you do have to watch your step and it may not be perfect for families with small children running around. We never met Michel, but Mon was very helpful and let us in even before check-in time and also fixed a small problem with one of the showers while we were out. 
********** nt

Michel's apartment was clean and (Website hidden by Airbnb) spacious enough for 6 people, though extends over 4 floors with a terrace and beautiful vistas from the top of the building...The neighbouhood is pretty untouristy, so a good local experience. After all, we enjoyed out stay!
********** po

Three of us enjoyed our stay at Michel's place. It's a warm and welcome apartment offers all the facilities you may need during a short stay. And the location is perfect which is walkable to most of the places you may be interested. And Michel speaks wonderful English and always replied quick. I'd like to highly recommend this place.
********** po

Really nice view!!! and host is very kind
********** po

Nice flat, nice neighbourhood, vey quiet, but all the cafes, restaurants etc. in Beyoglu are nearby, up a small hill. You also easily reach Tram, metro. The view from the terrace is really stunning! So the flat is like Michel describes. It is a very good base for exploring Istanbul. Michel was very helpful and it was easy to get in contact to him. We had two small children with us. With them it was not the very perfect spot because of small stone stairs in the flat, which were a bit dangerous. 
********** nt

We had a good time in Istanbul and a nice stay at Michels place. He waited for us in the apartment to give us the keys and to explain everything. He also organized us a shuttle back to the airport for a reasonable price, which was great. The place itself was a little bit hard to find for our taxi driver, but actually very good located to explore the hip area of Galata by foot. The place is big enough for 5, but more comfortable for 4 people. It's great that there are two bathrooms. The heating worked ok. It could have been a little bit warmer. All in all it's a good place to stay to explore the city for a great price. 
********** po

Pros: - very close to Istiklal - excellent price for the hole space if you are 3-6 people - nice terrace - the place is warm if the weather is not so good (like we had) - you can park near by with 3.5 euro per day - the beds from the first and third level are very comfortable Cons: - the photos are't down to earth - the first level bathroom is very small specially for a big person (the shower is 70X70 cm) - the second level bed is very unconfortable - the kitchen has mould - the house need a general refreshment operation (dusty furniture, smelly fridge, blotchy walls) - the guest wasn't prepared for our arriving
********** nt

Giant place for one person. Nice furnishings. Balcony, etc. Had a great stay. The beds have satiny sheets, just so you know.
********** po

The apartment is absolutely amazing, it has a wonderful mixture of Western and Ottoman styles in it. It has everything you wish or need during a stay in a large city as Istanbul. The neighbourhood is quite traditional, which is beautiful to experience, but within 5 minutes you are surrounded by a variety of shops in Istiklal Street. Mehmet is a great host; very caring and hospitable, he really wants you to have a wonderful time in his city. The best thing about the apartment is the feeling of 'being at home', with its warm atmosphere, all the utilities and the rich look. 
********** po

We really enjoyed our stay at Orucu Palace. The apartment was very clean and well located within the city. Mehmet was super friendly and very helpful. I recommend his place to anyone looking for a comfortable stay in Istanbul.
********** po

We had a great time in Istanbul and Mehmet was the best host one can wish for. Not only did he respond to our requests swiftly - he always did so with a kind smile on his face. The apartment is in a great location, just steps away from the hustle and bustle of Istiklal Avenue. We could not have asked for more!
********** po

Lovely apartment. Located at bottom of hill from main street and close to great bars and restaurants. close to tram stop too. well located. Mehmet was excellent and picked us up on arrival from Taksim Square which made it so easy to find the apartment as it is tucked away in a small street off the main street. lots of corner shops around for buying food and water too. Mehmet was very helpful and an excellent host. Apartment was fitted with everything you need and super clean.
We would stay there again. great for a couple or small group.
********** po

It was a pleasure staying at Orucu Palace as a guest of Mehmet Ali. Right from the moment of our arrival Mehmet was there if we needed anything - reminded us of the Genie from Arabian nights. We took an airport pick up and when we arrive at the guest house he was there half way up the street to guide us. He carried our heavy bags two flights up to the second floor - with a smile. On the day we were to leave, he also took us back to the airport in his car and was there at 5:15am, saving us the bother of ordering for a cab at this early hour. He was always ready for suggestions about transportation & shopping in Istanbul, which was really handy and saved us a lot of time & money. The place is very central - just about 3-4 minutes walk by a short cut from the Tophane bus/tram station. I believe it is located not very far from the bustling Istiklal Street. It was an uphill climb, so we did not attempt it being elderly guests. The apartment is very nice - neat & clean and well equipped. It was pre stocked with welcome drinks in the freezer and fresh fruits. The only minus (slight) was the approach to the apartment, otherwise I would unhesitatingly give it a 5-star. But this offset more than enough by the ever smiling & helpful Mehmet Ali (who is a 7-star host) The highlight of our stay was the smiling Mehmet Ali. Would strongly recommend Orucu Palace.
********** po

The Apartment was lovely, in a great location and Mehmet could not of been more helpful.
********** po

Mehmet is a most cheerful and helpful host: he gave us lots of useful advice, drove us to the airport, and even called us the day after we left to be sure we arrived safely at our next destination. He keeps the apartments spotless and is always on call to solve issues and answer questions. His building houses five individual carefully renovated apartments. It is located in Beyoglu, a quick downhill walk to the tram and a challenging uphill climb to the pedestrian shopping and dining Istiklal street. The Orucu Palace is a good choice if you want to experience life in Istanbul among the locals. Anyone with difficulty walking on cobblestone roads or climbing stairs might want to pass on this one, though. 
********** nt

We had a great time in Istanbul. Mehmet Ali is the most chanrming and helpful person one can dream and the apartment is very nice and clean, Ali M
********** po

We had a great stay at Orucu Palace. The apartment was in the perfect position, a few minutes walk to a very vibrant area with bars, restaurants and live music. Also, only a few minutes walk to the tram which can take you to all the main tourist attractions (which are also easy to get to on foot from the apartment). The apartment was comfortable and Mehmet made our stay pleasant and easy. The garden was a lovely place to relax and have a drink after a busy day.
********** po

We spent five nights here and really enjoyed it. The neighborhood is great, Zeyno is a local and has lots of useful recommendations, and the apartment is a lovely, airy, comfortable place with excellent views. Everything we needed was provided by our thoughtful host. We'll be back for sure!
********** po

This was a wonderful apartment in a great neighborhood. It was easy and fast to use public transit to get to all the major tourist destinations, but nice to be a bit removed from all the crowds. Zeyno was very kind, helpful, and responsive. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it to anyone traveling to Istanbul!
********** po

Nice apartment in a wonderful neighbourhood.
********** po

This apartment and its owner are a real find. We were so happy here that we doubled our stay. Zenyo is a gracious host and her top floor studio is perfect for anyone interested in more than just the old town attractions. The location is a short walk to Taksim (along Istiklal Caddesi), and the 'must-see' sites a tram ride away. Her neighbourhood is filled with cafes, antique stores, and the only (affordable) good coffee we could find in the city. Zenyo was generous with her home and also in sharing her knowledge of Istanbul. She made it easy for us to be independent, and so we were able to make the most of our time there. The best thing we could say about this place is that we would definitely stay there again. And we look forward to hosting you in our town!
********** po

This is a great little studio in a great location! And Zeyno is very helpful. I will stay there again. Only caveat: not a place for those prone to vertigo or who have trouble with steep stairs.
********** nt

Zeyno was very nice, the room and location were great, and we had a great time!
********** po

Very nice, clean studio in an atmospheric part of Istanbul. The place was great and so was Zeyno with her helpful advice and easy-to-follow instructions for how to get there. My girlfriend and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would do so again :)
********** po

Zeyno is lovely, her place is incredibly well appointed, comfortable and well located. When I am next in istanbul, I would definitely choose this space over any other. The bed is comfortable, the space is full of life - the kitchen facilities and shower/toilet are clean and convenient. This is a perfect little studio, with an incredible view and a great vibe. 
********** po

We enjoyed our stay in Zeyno's lovely apartment. The views are amazing!! The stairs to the apartment are really steep though. Perhaps not suitable if you are prone to vertigo ;) Emilia & Emilia
********** nt

My wife and I stayed in Zeyno's apartment for a week in late March 2011. We've stayed in a number of Airbnb places around the world and this is by far the best. Beautiful little flat up in the air overlooking beautiful Istanbul. About 25 min walk to the old town, or a very easy tram ride, fantastic neighborhood, cafes, bars, etc. Grocery store and well-equipped kitchen. Couldn't ask for much more. Thanks Zeyno!
********** po

While the building is close to Taksim, the building and interior spaces are very cramped. The winding staircase is typical of those in Istanbul, but this one is extremely narrow. The living space is tiny, about 10 ft.x 10 ft., while the bathroom is even more cramped, 6-7 feet deep but only about 2.5 ft. wide, so at 5' 8 my knees were against the opposite wall while sitting on the toilet. Murphy bed pulls down to sleep, but takes up most of the available space. Has a bay window, space taken up by small table and 2 folding stools. Small frig., microwave, and sink cabinet with coffee maker, toaster and hot pot. TV and WIFI. Heater, but NO Air Conditioning except for ceiling fan. Forget this place if you need quiet to sleep, since the nearby gay nightclub features all night bass drum pounding, usually til 5:00 a.m.
********** ng

Although the room is small and the bathroom is tiny, the bed was very comfortable, wi-fi is quick and, most importantly, it is only 5 min walk from the main street in Taksim and all it's shops, restaurants and nightlife. 
********** po

The apartment is really small, with a small bathroom. 
********** ng

I would like to say thank you to Mr Pala but I didn't have chance to meet him.. I paid for the studio but after he wrote me to give the duplex at the building..... It was very clean and everything was perfect... His friend was there too to help us... I spent 35 days without have any problem in the duplex.. Thank you again Mr Pala and I will be back again
********** po

Turkey is amazing country! I stayed 5 days at Engin's studio. It was very clean inside. Although the bathroom was small;) but with that price it is the best studio you have to find in Istanbul. The studio situated not far from Taksim square which u must to enjoy until the morning! It was very safety! Thank u Engin and Burak! Tesekkurler! :)
********** po

Every was correct, good situation, place small but clean with a biutiful view at the 3e floor ! Engin friend was very professionnal to explain me all the important things about the studio (keys, wifi...) and the directions to find a bus by exemple! 
********** po

I had a pleasant stay at the apartment. I stayed there for 7 nights. Although it wasn't this one specifically. He gave us an upgrade to a bigger room in the same building which was nice. The apartment was easy to find and in a very good location, near to the metro station and istiklal street which was good because we could go out and grab a bite anytime if we were hungry. And it's not so near the hustle and bustle that we would hear any noise to disturb our sleep. Honestly for the price I paid it really was a good bargain considering the location especially if you're not too fussy. The only thing you have to be aware is of the stairs(narrow and uneven) but from my understanding common in the more historic buildings like this in Istanbul. My mum complained about this but I didn't find this much of a problem for me. Especially if you're the backpacker type or you don't have much luggage, you'll be fine. Another thing would be the toilet which may be a problem if you are rather heavyset. I would actually recommend you guys to get the room that I eventually stayed in which is twice the size of the one I originally booked. You can find it under his other listings.
********** nt

I would highly recommend this place! Great location central to Taksim square and public transportation. His friend comes to meet you once you arrive and he also lives in the building so if there are ever any problems, they can be easily fixed. We didn't encounter any though! We had a great stay with an amazing view! 
********** po

We stayed in the duplex, and it was really nice! The location is perfect, close from everything, quiet at night. Engin's friend Burak helped us when we needed it. We really enjoyed our stay.
********** po

The apartment was at a great location. Very close to Taksim square and a quick walk to several stores and restaurants. Check in was very easy.
********** po

The accommodation Oksan offers is just perfect. You have everything, a clean, lovely room, with your own bathroom as well as the use of all kitchen facilities and a delicious Turkish breakfast with freshly steamed tea. I was also free to use the gorgeous roof terrace with its amazing views over the Bosporus and the Asian side of Istanbul and its relaxing feel in compensation of the bustle of Istanbul’s city life. But what made my stay really special were Oksan and her family, as amazingly helpful, open-minded and happy hosts. Located in a lush, green and quiet neighborhood the flat is very close to the center of Istanbul (Taksim), around the corner from Cihangir, and well communicated with buses and dolmus and the Kadiköy pier station for boat trips just 5 minutes walk away. Highly recommended!
********** po

I stayed with Oksan for a couple of days in late April 2012. She was a wonderful host. Her place is close to Taksim Square, and while I could have walked, I took a cab since I arrived in the wee hours of the morning. Oksan was kind enough to give directions to the taxi driver in Turkish, and was waiting for me by the roadside when I finally arrived. The room is cosy and comfortable, just perfect for a good night's sleep. Oksan, her husband and her son made me feel completely at home, always guiding me about local places and food. In fact, she prepared home-made breakfast for me each day, with home-made jams! She was almost motherly. I truly enjoyed my stay with Oksan and would highly recommend her to others. Oh, and make sure you check out her roof - gorgeous views from there!
********** po

Oksan is a fantastic host! When I arrived (and had no idea where I was going), she met me in Taksim square and walked me to her home. She made sure I had everything I needed during my stay, from soap to fresh towels to a cold drink when I arrived. Accomodations- the room itself where you stay is adedately sized, and the bed is very comfortable with nice sheets/comforter (almost as nice as I have in the US). The bathroom has everything you need, including a shower with plenty of hot water. I can't say enough about Oksan's terrace and the view! It is even more incredible than the pictures can do it justice! You're overlooking the Bosphorous with a view better than almost any place in that area. I definitely spent a few evenings drinking wine and enjoying that spectacular view of Istanbul. Oksan and her family love having guests, and go out of their way to make you feel at home. One night, they invited me to have dinner on the terrace with them (without charge of course)- this is something that is above and beyond what they had to do. Oksan loves to talk about the history of Istanbul and Turkey and Turkish culture. Her husband does not speak English, but he seems to understand a lot of it, and is very nice. Her son loves to discuss places to go and things to do while in Istanbul. This was my first experience booking with airbnb, and I was a little worried about what may happen in a situation like this (living in someone else's home with them). I must say though, after this fantastic experience, I have high expectations for future bookings!
********** po

I had a delightful stay with Oksan and her family—much better than I could have ever hoped for my first airbnb experience. The room is cozy but very spacious for one person, the bed comfortable, and the private bathroom right across the hall and impeccably clean. It all felt very private yet not at all removed from the warm home of which it is part. Oksan’s home is beautiful, with gorgeous views on the Bosphorus from every window and comfortable living rooms where one always feels welcome. And the terrace is even more spectacular than the photos show. Most importantly, Oksan, Can, and Tuncay are incredibly kind people and the most generous, welcoming hosts. The time we spent talking together was very special to me, and will remain among my fondest memories from my time in Istanbul. I left the city feeling I had made new friends.
********** po

I can't imagine a more special place to stay in all of Istanbul. The views of the Bosphorous are breathtaking, especially from the rooftop terrace. On the terrace, between the beautiful plants everywhere and the views of the water and city, it makes you never want to leave. Oksan is an absolutely amazing host. She is so warm, kind, friendly and generous that I immediately felt comfortable. Now that I'm back home I really miss her!! Oksan was like a mom to me during my stay. Tuncay (her husband) and Can (her son) are equally as warm and kind. The breakfasts Oksan made were so delicious and beautiful, I wish I would have taken photos of them. She taught me about Turkey, recommended place to see and made my stay in Istanbul so much more than I ever imagined. Thank you with all my heart Oksan!! I hope to return some day soon.
********** po

Words cannot describe my gratitude toward Oksan and her son Ashir. I was in Istanbul alone for business and decided to also discover the city during the weekend. They are extremely nice people who showed me the true meaning of the word hospitality in every way. They made me feel so good at home that I sometimes felt like a spoiled kid. I already miss the fun conversations with Oksan who is a really generous woman with a great ‘joy de vivre’. Also her son Ashir is a nice person to hang out with. The family was also really helpful to find my way around. The apartment is well located in the central but at the same very quiet part of Istanbul where you can easily grab a metro, bus or tram closeby to discover the rest of the city (Taskim 5 min by foot). You have your own private bedroom (single bed with nice matress) and bathroom. The rooftop terrace with Bosphorus view is a great extra feature. Already miss you guys! But glad to know I also have a family in Istanbul now.
********** po

Had I not stayed with Oksan in Istanbul I'd really have missed out! She is lots of fun with plenty of interesting stories to tell, and one of the best hostesses I have ever met. She went out of her way to make me feel completely at ease in her beautiful home from the moment I arrived until the moment I left. The combined bedroom/sitting room she rents to guests is extremely comfortable and attractive, with thoughtful touches including maps of Istanbul and brochures of activities in the city. As for the rooftop terrace overlooking the Bosphorous mentioned by previous reviewers - they weren't exaggerating! Gorgeous! I can't recommend staying with Oksan highly enough. Taksim is a great area of the city to stay in, however I would mention that if you are not able to climb up and down a lot of stairs, it may not be ideal for you. On the other hand a little exercise never goes astray and did me a world of good!
********** po

It´s a fantastic host. If I ever be on my own again in istanbul, I will ask Oksan. For one person there is no better host in town. Nice room, perfect location, friendly people.
********** po

My stay with Oksan was my first experience with airbnb and I could not have asked for such a kind and considerate host. Oksan, her husband, and son treated me extremely well. She introduced me to her friends and took me on a tour through Taksim. She was very open, sharing many of her stories and even making a Turkish style breakfast for me every morning. The location is great, it is walking distance to two major metro lines, easily accessible to both airports via the Havatas bus and surrounded by many delicious restaurants. It is in a quiet location so I was able to sleep soundly every night. The room itself is very clean, it has its own private bathroom and is right next to the door so you don't disturb the hosts. The house is very nice and comfortable. Upstairs the views of Istanbul and the Bosphorus sea was fantastic. Istanbul is an amazing city, but being able to interact with Turkish locals who made me feel extremely welcome and at home made the experience unforgettable.
********** po

What can I say, faith in humanity has been restored! Oskan and her family were extraordinarily warm and friendly. My experience in Istanbul was enriched by meeting them. I now consider them friends. The conversations over teas and sweets helped me understand the history behind the country and consildated all the information i gathered in the museums. They are a perfect example of what airbnb is trying to do. I award this host with the highest of recommendations. I thank them sincerely for their hospitality. Cyrus
********** po

It is a nice place in a very central area. baris is a great host.
********** po

The flat is great, good location, close to Taksim and very close to the tram station and port, There is a nice big terrace on the fourth floor and you can enjoy great view of the Bosphorus. We have seen our host at last day of our trip and he was very cheerful and nice guy. Also we want to thank Senna, a friend of host to meet us and let us in the flat.

Baris.s flat was a great base for exploring Istanbul - close to Taksim Square and Kabatas ferry and tram. The basement flat was very quiet and the garden area means it also gets plenty of light . Good wi-fi connection, I didn't get a chance to explore the shared roof terrace. Hope to be back in the future.
********** po

Great communication location and transportation! Great place to crash after a long day running around the city. I had a minor issue with electricity and Baris had it fixed immediately. Thank you!!!
********** po

We lived in Baris's apartment 10 days. Location of the flat is very convenient, 5 minutes to Taksim Square and 5 minutes from the marina Kabatazh. The owner is very friendly. the apartment is not big. but cozy. The only drawback is the lack of normal plates and broken microwave. But it is possible, for example, order a pizza at home. We recommend this apartment, considering it an economical option announcement is in Istanbul. Genia and her mum

We had a fine time for our eleven nights in this apartment. The location is excellent. It´is easy to get to almost anywhere any visitor wants to go. But it´s in a neighborhood of ordinary Istanbullis, with few tourists. Inside, it´s perfectly quiet all the time. A fine place for everyone who is comfortable walking the 50+ steep steps up to the building from the tram stop. The apartment is large, light and airy, and very clean. The furnishings are adequate,with a really good bed, though there is little decoration. The appliances and fixtures are all pretty functional. It feels a lot like an American college student apartment. It´s fine for people who don´t care about luxuries. The small backyard gets good morning sun and is convenient for drying clothes. Whenever you want, you can climb the stairs to the rooftop patio, which has a breathtaking view of the Bosporus and many great sights. Terrific at night. Baris is a delightful guy who is always ready to be helpful if you need anything.

The apartment is in great location, the roof terrace is absolutely amazing!!we spend a couple of hours there every night when we got home. It's great to see the sunrise! The apartment itself is what you see in the pictures so if you're looking for something fancy, it's not for you.....otherwise its perfect. We got lost when we got to Taksim square cause Baris instructions were a bit vague...but once we met him he was very cool and gave us some information to where to go and how to et to places, very helpful! Overall it was a great experience!
********** po

Baris's flat is in a great location. Close to Kabatas station, Taksim square. Baris was friendly and very helpful, easy to contact. Although there are some steep steps on the way home, it is not to long of a walk, we did not mind to much. The garden and terrace on the roof is also great. I recommend!!
********** po

Very nice apartment with amazing terrace. Sufficient kitchen equipement. Everything has remainded me of old good, student times.
********** po

The flat is very well situated, near from tram station and everything in Beyoglu. Everything that is on the description is true. The problem is that the flat is not very clean. The kitchen is not in a good condition. All personnal objects of the owner are messy in the appartment. In conclusion: practical appartment, but expensive for the condition.
********** ng

Great property, modern, clean, exactly as advertised. In a great location in the heart of the luxury Nisantasi district of Istanbul. It is a bit removed from the old city, a 5 minute walk to the metro (then transfer to streetcar), or 15 minutes walk to Taksim and funicular or historic tramway. Fully equipped kitchen, plenty of bed linens, plates and glasses for a family stay.
********** po

A well maintained serviced-apartment type flat in a chic European-feel Istanbul neighborhood. Taxim Sq. is about 8 minutes by taxi at a cost of 8-10 TL. We had no issues with the flat and our stay was pleasant, can recommend the place. Something to note though is that flats in this block are being apparently rented on other sites and owner is not maintaining Airbnb calendar to provide actual availability. Asking prices for us were also higher than those displayed on the calendar, but comparing to other sites it was still a better deal. Your mileage may vary.
********** nt

Absolutely marvelous apartment the photos don’t do the justice, it is spacious comfortable very well equipment very clean. It is situated in very nice European neighborhood a safe Parking and a mini market in 50 meters, and it is about 15 minutes walking distance from Taksim square. The persons from the reception were very polite and the owner is excellent in his communication and his services. I definitely will visit it again. 
********** po

Really enjoyed our stay. Apartment was modern clean and had everything we needed. Thanks!
********** po

The flat is just as seen on the pictures: clean, clear, spacious, with all the necessary furniture and utensils, as well as soaps, cleaning powder and all necessary equipment. The receptionist at the entrance is very helpful and nice. The first day, when we arrived, one electrical bulb. When I signaled it to the receptionist, he immediately replaced it. In the booking process, Cevdet was responded very quickly to my requests and questions, and also accommodated our special requests immediately. I clearly recommend this flat in a very nice area of Istanbul! Best, Emmanuel 
********** po

Great apartment in a fantastic location. Booked at the last minute with Toni, and he kindly waited two hours for us when our bus was delayed. Thank you!
********** po

Toni was a great host and looked after me in BA. Apartment was great and very comfortable, perfect location and close to everything you need. Recommend to anyone!
********** po

Toni is a great guy and has a great loft, better than the photos show!! The neighborhood, Palermo Hollywood, is also fantastic, really lively, full of bars and shops. Definitely we would repeat the experience, and we strongly recommend the place!!
********** po

The apartment is very well located in the beautiful area of Parlermo, very close to all restaurants and bars. It looks like the pictures, modern, spacious and clean. HOWEVER, the heating system is not working (we were cold inside), you need to login to the neighbor's wireless network to use internet and it is very noisy, days and nights. ALSO, we had a pretty bad experience with the whole renting process. Although the host seems to be a very nice guy, we never met him as he lets a real estate agency manage the apartment. Because of this, we had to go to the other side of the city to get the keys and there, we were almost forced to sign a contract as the agents were not aware of the whole AirBnB thing. MOST IMPORTANTLY, we went through a really unpleasant episode. Nobody ever told us that other people would have the keys of the apartment. One day at the beginning of our stay, while we were not here, someone from the real estate agency, Alojargentina, came in the apartment to grab invoices. That was surprising but not really a problem. Another day, a cleaning lady knocked on the door and explained she was sent by the agency. She was not supposed to come back before we left but actually did: this time, we were stolen 300 pesos while we were in the apartment! CONSEQUENTLY: we decided to leave the apartment before the end of our booking as persons we could not trust had access to the place and we had already been rubbed once. This meant that we had to rent another place and pay two lodgings. When we explained the situation to the host, he politely replied that he was sorry and did not even offer a refund for the day we did not spend in his apartment, saying that this was exceptional, since the real estate agency had always provided great services to all guests. MY ADVICE: do not rent this place, whether it is for one day or one month.
********** ng

We had a pleasant stay at the apartment! Toni was easy to communicate with when we first arrived, and throughout our stay. He recommended transportation from the airport, among other things. He was a pleasant host! FYI there is quite a bit of paperwork and contracts to go over for the building. Positives: -LOCATION! Several coffee shops, restaurants, brunch places all within walking distance - Apartment was spacious and clean when we arrived. - Veronica, who checked us in, was great, we did not have any problems with check-in. She conducted the inventory and just quickly went over it with me. - Kitchen was fully stocked and we enjoying cooking meals. - The internet worked well. We used the neighbors wi-fi during the week since the internet in the apartment was only cable. But it worked out fine. - Balcony was clean - Couch was comfortable - Kitchen table was great sized, very nice. - Bathtub was nice, clean Room for improvement: - Showerhead was broken, which made for interesting showers - Mosquitos + spiders: we both were bitten quite a bit during our stay - It was pretty loud at night, but I think it’s just a busy street. Overall it was a great stay, but the apartment did not provide small things that make the apartment turnkey, such as paper towels, garbage bags, olive oil for cooking, and dish soap. I would confirm that Toni has provided these before your stay, or bring them with you. 
********** nt

Nothing to complain about. The listing description is completely accurate, the neighborhood is really nice. I had a pleasant stay! :)
********** po

Toni was fantastic to work with - kind and quick with communication and accommodating with my travel plans. The house is perfectly located, high ceilings and just the perfect homebase to explore the magical city of Buenos Aires. All in all a great experience that I would repeat myself and recommend to others. Alda was a doll too. Thumbs up!
********** po

Thank you, I had a great stay in Buenos Aires, the apartment is convenient and well located!
********** po

Beautiful loft! Perfect location in the hip neighbourhood of Palermo Hollywood. Toni is the ideal host--responsive, hospitable and all around excellent! Highly recommended to all.
********** po

Bad experience.
********** ng

Amazing place! Location: short walk to all the bars and shops in Palermo soho and hollywood, plus also the subway Apartment: v modern and with all you could want. Living room was perfect for relaxing in with a large sofa, massive TV and amazing view through the floor to ceiling windows. Bedroom hits the spot with a big windows, wardrobe and comfy bed. Bathroom also of the same standard Building: has an amazing gym set-up on the 31 floor - always seemed to be empty and a real pleasure to use. 
********** po

Really enjoyed Candela's recommendations and quick communication! Had a wonderful time in BsAs, enjoy this apartment!
********** po

Candela and her colleague were very attentive and quick to respond, absolutely wonderful. The apartment is beautiful, well equipped and conveniently located close to the historic part of Palermo, bars and excellent restaurants. I highly recommend this place.
********** po

The apartment was in a beautiful, modern building, was wonderfully decorated and equip with all of the modern amenities. We not only loved the apartment, but the location was ideal. We were walking distance to the Subte and to my job in Palermo Soho. We were surrounded by lots of restaurants and boutiques. The only issue with this apartment is the noise. The neighbors on our floor had a dog that barked constantly and often times woke us up at night. We spoke with Candela who tried to help us solve the issue and it seems as though many neighbors have complained about dogs in the building and that they might be more selective in the future. We hope that's the case because it's a beautiful place to live otherwise.
********** nt

My stay at Candela's apartment was very enjoyable. The apartment looks exactly like the photos. Candela is very hospitable and does everything to make the stay enjoyable. I would recommend this place to anyone wishing to visit Buenos Aires. The location is also an added bonus, very close to the D line Subte and bus connections from Plaza Italia. The parks are very close by as are many great restaurants and coffee shops. 
********** po

Very nice place, just as shown in the pictures. Close to everything - stores, Palermo Viejo, botanical garden, and the subte station. Candela made everything easy. Thanks!
********** po

We had admired the Palermo Uno building on previous visits to Buenos Aires and it did not disappoint. The location is prime, and the apartment, furnishings, building amenities and security are all first-rate. Candela is a friendly, gracious host, and her onsite manager could not have been more helpful. The view from the gym on the 31st floor is the visual definition of awesome. Thanks for a great experience!
********** po

Candela did a great job accommodating us. While she was not there personally, she had a friend meet us at the unit and let us in and get us situated. Any issues we had were quickly fixed. The unit itself is in an excellent location. Close to the parks and attractions in and around the park (zoo, planetarium, Japanese gardens, MALBA) as well as all of the great restaurants in Palermo SOHO. We could not have asked for a better location. The unit was also clean and had some good books on BA to review. The bed was very comfortable!The unit had a decent gym and good security. The only negative was noise. The sounds of dogs and babies was so loud they sounded like they were in the unit. There is also a water pipe in the wall that is poorly insulated so you constant hear water flushing through the pipes. If you're a light sleeper, this apartment isn't for you. Otherwise it is fantastic and in a great location. 
********** nt

Candela was a very good host. Although I did not meet her in person she was quick to respond to any questions or concerns. The apartment itself is just as described. I was very comfortable for the two months that I lived there, the bed was wonderful, and everything worked perfectly in the apartment. In terms of the location, it was also very convenient, near the metro (Plaza Italia) and Santa Fe, which has all the bus connections you could ever need. My one caveat would be that the neighbors have a very annoying dog that barks all the time. It didn't really bother me much because I sleep very deep and I was out of the house most of the day, but if you are a light sleeper this might be an issue. Sadly this is out of Candela's control, but it would only be fair to mention it. Beyond that, I would recommend this apartment and great building.
********** nt

The Palermo neighborhood is great for guests with easy access to the subway and many restaurants! Candela is very responsive and helpful. It was very easy and convenient to stay here.
********** po

Matt was great gave me lots of information about the city answered any questions i had. The place is exactly 
as advertised. if you are new to the city Matt's place would be a great place to stay. Thank you so much Matt Chuck Kelowna Canada
********** po

My stay with Matt was great. I initially thought staying in the living room might be close quarters, but it really wasn't a problem in the end. Matt was also an excellent host. He showed me around town, and since I was staying in Buenos Aires for a while, gave me lots of tips about local culture and ways to make living here easier. He's also a really open, nice guy, with interesting stories to share.
********** po

My review of Matt is short and sweet. I didn't want to leave! That should say everything.
********** po

Matt is a awesome guy, he likes to share experiences w/ you. I really recomend him as a host for other guests.
********** po

Absolutely stellar. Matt's apartment is very well-furnished, and probably the only place in my whole stay in South America in which i felt the air conditioning was adequate! He is also an ideal host. I basically felt like I got a free tour of Buenos Aires, with his expertise, and truly ideal advice about what to do while there. If I hadn't started my trip at his place, I wouldn't have had half as much fun.
********** po

I was very pleased to be so lucky to find such a place as Matt's. He is a delightful person and so we could spend a nice diner talking with him. He showed us around and gave us tips about places of our interest. He was most helpful. in everything we needed. I definetely recomend his place. Matt is a very tidy clean person too. So no worries to be staying at his appartment. Thank you Matt, we enjoyed meeting you.
********** po

I stayed with Matt for a couple days in Buenos Aires. It is in a great location for walking and taking public transportation. The best part of staying with Matt was him showing me around his neighboorhood and surrounding area. He used to be a tour guide, and he really knows his stuff! I wouldn't have even gotten all that information if I researched for hours. I was also there during a holiday so the vibe of the city was a little different than usual (from what I gather) but Matt helped me find open places to explore. The couch bed was also comfortable!
********** po

Matt's place is exactly as advertized: nice apartment; sofa bed; nice location in Recoleta. Matt himself was incredibly flexible and patient with my arrival time, which changed. Above all, he is a good guy to hang out with. I learned more about Argentina in two hours with Matt than I had in two weeks before meeting him. Great host!
********** po

Matt was awesome. Very hospitable and knows the city like the back of his hand. His place in Recoleta is also very conveniently located. Highly recommended!
********** po

Great apartment in a very central location, something non negotiable in Buenos Aires where the subway only have connections in the micro centre of the city. The apartment was clean, functional and the couch/bed comfortable. Matt is a very nice host willing to give advice if you don't know what to visit or where to eat! He also was very flexible with the hours of check in/out, which was very much appreciated. I would totally recommend his place ! 
********** po

Happy House was an amazing experience ! The apartment is well located in Palermo, super cosy and nice ! And Manuel is the nicest person that you can meet in Buenos Aires for sure, he was always ready to help us, give us some advice ! Happy House is THE place to stay for sure!
********** po

Great location, very clean house, Mercedes is a great host, absolutely recommended for any duration.
********** po

Manuel and Mercedes were perfect hosts: quick to respond to any inquiry before and during my stay, flexible, friendly and very welcoming, and offering plenty of advice. The apartment is well located, very comfortable, and fitted with all conveniences. For a hassle-free stay in BA, I couldn't recommend Happy House more highly. Thanks Mercedes!
********** po

Spent two weeks at Happy House. The house was well appointed and well situated next to a subway, several grocery stores and a variety of restaurants, bars and cafes. It is also quite central and close to Palermo Soho and Hollywood. Check in and check out was easy. The owner really took care in making my stay a pleasant one. Since she knew I was going to be working from the apartment, she even took the time to rearrange the living room ahead of my arrival - without me having to ask - so that my work desk would be well positioned next to a window. My flight out of Buenos Aires was at night, and there was absolutely no problems when I asked to check out at 6pm. The Internet is a bit slow, but still works well for sending emails and surfing the Web. I'd have no problems recommending the apartment to anyone going to Buenos Aires.
********** po

I was at the Mercedes home 4 days and I felt at home. The apartment is very comfortable, the location is great for exploring the city and Mercedes is available for any information. I would recommend staying in the apartment of Mercedes at all.
********** po

I had a lovely week at Happy House! Manuel and Mercedes were perfect hosts: attentive, quick to respond to any inquiry before and during my stay, flexible, friendly, honest, very welcoming, and offering plenty of advice. The apartment is beautifully, great location (near shops, Sta Fe, Alto Palermo shopping and tube station), very comfortable, and fitted with all conveniences. I warmly and highly recommend Happy House and I Iook forward to my next stay. Thanks Manuel and Mercedes! 
********** po

Both Mercedes and Manuel were very welcoming guests. The happy house is a peaceful place in the middle of BA - Palermo and a great base for exploring the city. Thanks a lot, Stijn & Katrien
********** po

Manuel was truly an awesome guest. The apartment is super cute and very nicely located of off Santa Fe Avenue. Eventhough the internet connection was spotty at times Manuel was very responsive in promising to take care of it soon for future guests. Still, the overall experience was magnificent. I actually forgot my wallet and camera at the appartment and after I notified him, Manuel found it and Fedexed it to me the next day. Highly reccomended!
********** po

Mercedes is the perfect host ! We were very happy in the Happy House ! The appartement is very nice, quiet (well, as quiet as possible in this huge Buenos Aires querido), clean, warmful, cheerful, decorated with a lot of delicate attention, the floor (parquet) in the living was perfect for practice and private tango classes. A lot of milongas in the neighbourhood, Palermo is a tango barrio ... Gracias por todo ! Keep in touch for next time, un abrazo enorme to Mercedes and Manuel ! Laura y Bruno
********** po

Happy House was clean, cozy, and cute with all the amenities we needed. It was also well situated and a great base from which to explore the city. The hosts were very friendly and made themselves readily available to address questions. Overall, a great place to stay!
********** po

I just got back from Buenos Aires - and Mariano's delightful apartments were a highlight. Not only is San Telmo the epitome of what we were hoping to find in BA, the lofts themselves are light, airy and beautifully kept. Mariano is always helpful, always smiling, and always someone we'd happily recommend! 
********** po

We hired 3 rooms from Mariano and we had a very good experience in San Telmo. It was nice and tidy and felt safe. I can really recommend Mariano for other travellers to Buenos Aires. Joakim S - Stockholm / Sweden
********** po

We loved staying at Mariano's apartments on Calle Mexico. The location is fabulous. Great restaurants, bakeries nearby and easy to walk anywhere. The bed was really comfortable. The unit was really quiet and so cozy. We had all the kitchen equipment that we needed and there was a grocery store nearby for coffee and food. The only thing to be aware of is that the air conditioning is either all on or all off for all the apartments on one floor at the same time. We would highly recommend staying here. Mariano is a great guy with a great attitude and his apartments are really a quiet and wonderful refuge in fabulous Buenos Aires!
********** po

The neighborhood made us a little nervous at night, but we gradually got used to it. It was great to be near the San Telmo fair on Sundays. The space itself was nice, although a little older and darker than expected. Overall our stay was good.
********** nt

Had a fine time in BA! Did not get to meet Mariano (he was working & out of town), but the loft was comfy and conveniently located for walking & public transport. The San Telmo district is probably best for younger folks, with it's broken sidewalks and doggy droppings all around, but it is a very interesting area with great tango, good food & fun people watching. I would definitely consider returning!
********** po

The apartment is really nice. The patio and the roof terrace make it a very special place. Many thanks Stefan PS: Excellent Peruvian / Japanese fusion restaurant nearby: (Website hidden by Airbnb)
********** po

The communication with Mariano was great. He was helpful with everything that i asked and he always replied within a few minutes or hours. The place is a great option for a couple or 3 people. It is located in San Telmo, blocks away from great restaurants and clubs (Gran Parilla Del Plata on Peru and Club One on Adolfo Alsina are my top choices). The subway (Subte) is just around the corner.
********** po

Really well situated apartment in Monserrat (i.e. just north of San Telmo) close to the subtle and only a short walk from all of San Telmo, Plaza de Mayo and Calle Florida. The shared areas are fantastic, giving you extra space beyond the loft apartment and providing the place with a real sense of tranquility, while Elbio is a very enthusiastic and obliging host. It's worth pointing out that the apartment is a part of complex rented out to travellers - which meant someone came in and cleaned the room one day (which was great!) but we didn't know about it beforehand and left a whole bunch of stuff out (not so great). And while the kitchen is functional, it is really small, which might be difficult if you are keen to eat in, but there's so many good cheap restaurants nearby that you really wouldn't need (i.e. want) to!
********** nt

Perfect place to be in downtown Buenos Aires, and yet, enjoy the tranquility needed. The host is very helpful and friendly, and the loft is very spacious. I will definitely will go back again! PS: Check the roof.. ;^)
********** po

Nice little loft, everything was clean and the common out door space was very good as well. Enjoyed my stay there.
********** po

I stayed at her loft for some days and loved the place. The location is great (just a few blocks from Puerto Madero) so you can go there for a walk everytime you feel like. The loft has a lot of character and was quite confortable. I definatly stay there again on future trips to Buenos Aires. Thanks Alejandra!
********** po

We had a great stay at Alejandras very cool loft. Fantastic location with great trantsport, restaurants, coffee, Antiques, clothing shops 2 seconds away. Alejandra is a pleasure to deal with, and really attentive to every need. Definately recommend.
********** po

Alejandra was very accommodating and helpful during my stay. Her apartment is lovely and I recommend it to anyone who is looking to stay in San Telmo.
********** po

Very comfortable apartment and Alejandra was a great host. She always responded very quickly to our questions via email and was flexible with checkin/out. Good location for exploring the city and close to Retiro station.
********** po

I realized Alejandra is a great host since the very first message she wrote on airb&b. She always answers quickly and she is a very kind and warm person. We arrived earlier than what was planned, and I don't know how she intuitively knew it and called us offering to meet us earlier. The place is really well located, it's ample, well decorated, and it's a great place to arrive to after being all day out. We had a problem with the elevator as we arrived, but Alejandra helped us with the heavier luggage. During the rest of our stay it worked properly. Couch and single bed were not that comfortable, but that's not a problem if it is only two of you travelling together, since there's a super comfy king size bed upstairs. Will definitely go to her loft again, and of course I have already recommended to my friends. 
********** po

We had a great time in Buenos Aires and Alejandra's loft was always a comfortable and quiet place to return to each evening. San Telmos is a unique and interesting place to stay - the loft is on a very busy street, freaked us out a bit at first, but head around the corner to some of the more interesting places in BA. Alejandra is very helpful and accomodating - we highly recommend staying here.
********** po

We loved our week-long stay at Alejandra's amazing loft. She was a very accommodating host and made it easy for us to get settled in. The location of the flat is excellent--San Telmo is a cool neighborhood and it was easy to get to other parts of BA either on foot or by subway. Highly recommended!
********** po

We had a fantastic stay at Alejandra's place! Couldn't ask for a better location, right in the heart of San Telmo! Her tidy loft and its decor certainly captures the romantic, bohemian side of that barrio!! Excellent host too what more can we say!! ...see you in July if all goes well!
********** po

After a trip of more than 3 weeks around Argentina, we ended our holiday for 5 days in Buenos Aires. The loft of Alejandra was a welcoming place of rest. Although at a busy street, it has alle the charm of San Telmo just around the corner. It is a fine place and Alejandra is a very friendly and welcoming host. We can only highly recommend it.
********** po

This is a brilliant apartment and is in a great area. I really enjoyed my time here. Not only is the apartment safe, the loft layout is wonderful. San Telmo is a great area, with its cafes, markets etc. Also I am a gay man and the apartment is very near the Pride Cafe, a great spot for finding out about Gay Buen Airies. However, the biggest attraction of the apartment is the host Alejandra who is made me so welcome. Any time I contacted Alejandra with a query she would respond quickly in a helpful manner. Overall I would highly recommend this lovely appartment and I really enjoyed my time there. 
********** po

Arturo and his wife, Alejandra are perfect owners. The building is near anything you'd want to do, in the heart of Recoleta. The building also has an amazingly helpful porter (manager) who is always ready to assist. I stayed there for four months and would definitely try to stay there again if in BA in the future.
********** po

Everything we needed was available here. The neighborhood is safe In addition, there is part time doorman and a locked front entrance. The apartment is located in a great area of Recoletta, near everything. A small convenience grocery store is immediately beside the building. In addition, the Megatlon Health club (which has a large indoor pool) is on the same block. the club sells short term memberships, so for someone who likes to swim or needs to work out, this is a perfect location. Arturo and his wife are lovely people
********** po

Arturo is an absolute pleasure to deal with. Communication was easy via email before I arrived, and he made sure I had all questions answered during my stay as well. You can tell that Arturo is genuinly interested in assisting the people he rents his apartment out to, especially if they are new in town (or country), like myself. The apartment itself is in the perfect location, with access to the subway and many buses. There is a small grocery shop right next door, a gym and many great restaurants. If I travel to Buenos Aires again, I would try to stay here again. Overall, great apartment & location, perfect host :)
********** po

Arturo was a very nice host, he answered all my questions via email very quickly. He offered to come to the appartement at 1am without hesitation (my flight was very late). He assisted with all my questions and explained where everything is. The appartement looks exactly as in the pictures, the kitchen has everything needed and even the cleaning of the appartement is included. The appartement is located in a good place, we explored the whole city from here and thought it was very convenient. If I'm ever back in Buenos Aires I would try to stay here again
********** po

This apartment was awesome. Very clean, very central and most important - the hosts were amazing. They were super helpful, sending us several emails trying to give us the best stay we could have in buenos aires. Also, there was fresh fruit and cold water provided. I definitely recommend this apartment for every couple or single traveler. Very welcoming and helpful. I will definitely stay here again when I am in town again!! 
********** po

Arturo and his wife were very friendly and responsive, we had a problem with the hot water for our shower and he had the super fix it immediately and we enjoyed hot showers for the rest of the week. He was helpful in calling us a taxi when we needed one early in the morning. He also checked in with us regularly to make sure we were enjoying our stay in Buenos Aires and got all we needed. Our flight out of the city was late at night, and Arturo was also flexible in letting us check out a little later which was super helpful. 

Apartment itself was neat and fully equipped with steady Wifi and was true to photos posted (good size for solo or couple travelers). Location was convenient as it was close to the main avenue and also walking distance to the subway D line. There is a grocery store right next to the building in case you need to stock up on water and snacks. All in all a good experience and highly recommended.
********** po

The deal price-location is the perfect reason to choose this place. The studio is basic, but very clean and well equiped. Pleasant bathroom. Good matress. Excellent wifi. Arturo and his wife are very kind and do show that they care about you being confortable.
********** po

Safe location. Close to restaurants, shops, and grocery stores. 5min walk to Callao subway station to get anywhere in the city. Fast WiFi. Perfect size for a couple. Very secure building with friendly porter. Arturo is very kind and wants to make sure you are well looked after and have a good time in BA. Maid service on Mondays = awesome.
********** po

Our stay in Arturo's apartment was wonderful. The area is perfectly central to all the important attractions in Buenos Aires. Many are within walking distance. Arturo and his wife were very accommodating and helpful with information to make the most of our short stay. The apartment has everything a single person or couple could want, and everything worked perfectly. (We loved the shower!) I highly recommend staying in Arturo's apartment.
********** po

Arturo was a wonderful host. He and his wife met us at the studio and went through all aspects and features of the studio. They had fruit, crackers and water bottles waiting on us as well. Arturo checked in with me the next day to make sure everything was okay or if we needed any assistance. When the temperature dropped dramatically one day, we returned to find a nice warm blanket for the bed waiting for us. The studio is simple, clean and affordable (and the location is perfect!) Thanks Arturo for being such a great host!
********** po

Sergio was very helpful and friendly, the apartment was very nice and I enjoyed the area. There are lots of great cafes and restaurants close by. Olsen on Gorilitti is amazing. I've moved to Recoletta now which is much busier, I think it's nice to experience both areas
********** po

We had a wonderful trip to Buenos Aires. The apartment was beautiful and the location was perfect. Sergio was very accommodating and could not do enough for us. I would highly recommend this location!!!!
********** po

I rented one of Sergio's 2 bedroom apartments for 4 people and we had a fabulous time. The apartment had all the modern amenities and it was clean, affordable and in the best location. Palermo is a beautiful neighborhood and we had cute cafes and restaurants within blocks of the apartment. Sergio was responsive to all my questions and very accommodating. He let me know in advance that the original apartment we had booked would be unavailable, so he put us up in the same apartment on another floor of the building and gave us a free nights stay. Worked out perfectly. I would stay here in a heartbeat the next time I visit Buenos Aires.
********** po

This was a beautiful apartment in a beautiful neighborhood in an amazing city!! I have used Airbnb several times before, but this is by far, the best place I have ever stayed. The apartment is gorgeous with an amazing view of BA. It is also in the perfect neighborhood, walking distance to some great restaurants, bars and shopping. The apartment is the perfect size for 2-4 people, is well decorated and the beds extremely comfortable. Sergio was extremely nice and great to work with. He even helped us call a car service for our trip to the airport and worked around our travel schedule. When I make it back to BA, this is where I am staying.
********** po

Sergio is a great host, helping you out with any questions you might have in BA. As for the apartment, is absolutely top shelf in Buenos Aires. I am definitely staying in this apartment next time Im in town. 
********** po

Beautiful appartment, confortable, well situated with amazing view. Sergio and Mariano did everything to make our stay the best possible. Thanks guys! We ll be back! 
********** po

Sergio's apartment is *amazing*. It is very clean, modern, comfortable, and has these breathtaking city views that can be seen from both terraces (or where the pool is as well). Sergio was very patient with me during my 1st time booking through AirBnB and even while I wasn't sure if it would be one or two guests. He also accommodated a very early morning check-out (3:30 a.m.) and Mariano, who also helped with check-in, helped to arrange a reliable taxi. Sergio's apartment has a nice binder with all the information in it a visitor could need or want which was excellent. It is close to many restaurants, bars, and cafes. It also happened to be about a 10 minute walk to where I was taking Tango lessons with Tango Piola which was wonderful and convenient. I hope that when I come back to Buenos Aires I can stay in this beautiful apartment again!
********** po

Had a wonder time in Sergio's Penthouse. Everything was just as described and in the pictures. Location is fantastic and very close walking distance to all the wonderful restaurants, clubs, bars. Very short taxi ride to all the other burrows.
********** po

This apartment was all that it was said to be. Sergio was a great host and had all ready for us on our arrival. I would stay at this apartment when I return to BA.
********** po

Sergio was a fantastic host, and proved to be super flexible and accomodating to my changing schedule. This flat is thoughtfully designed and I would highly recommend it to anyone. Really made a tremendous difference to have such a nice place to stay in BA.
********** po

Overall our stay in the San Telmo apartment was really enjoyable, the location is fantastic full of life and activity, great places to eat and loads of interesting antique shops and the market on sunday along Bolivar was really interesting. the apartment was for the most part just what i was looking for, it had plenty of charm and character (this may not suit everyone) there was loads of natural light and air flow. One should bear in mind that the apartment is in the heart of San Telmo which is quite different to the posher areas like Palermo and Recoleta. there were a few issues with the water during our stay that were beyond anyone's control, Nicky was quick to respond to the situation, even though she was overseas herself. At the time it was stressful but looking back it was just part of the big Buenos Aires experience, and certainly didn't ruin my trip by any means. Nicky was very friendly to deal with in all stages of the process - from the initial inquiry through to the few hiccups we had along the way, i have no hesitation in recommending her apartment as a place to stay. 
********** po

Amazing! The loft was perfect and the host very helpful. Don't hesitate to book it :))
********** po

Excellent flat in San Telmo steps away from great dining, entertainment and public transport. Her place is very sunny, spacious and clean! I would highly recommend staying at Nicola's place. 
********** po

This loft was really, really, really chic! We really enjoyed to stay in Nicky`s flat. It actually looks more pretty as it looks on the pictures already. As long you are a fan of antique furniture. Everything worked fine, but it can get a little bid cold as we noticed. The contact via her manager, Eva was very easy. We were able to check in at 8am, because we reached the city by bus overnight. Also we got the chance to stay until 6pm before our departure in the evening. So we had two full days for sightseeing. Its nice located in the center of San Telmo. Its a pity that we haven't booked this apartment already on our first stay. Thank you a lot! 
********** po

We really enjoyed our stay at Nickys apartement, the location is great, the flat beautifuly decorated and the comunication with Nicky was quite easy and friendly! Nos gustó mucho nuestra estancia, el apartamento esta bien situado, lindo decorado y la comunicación con Nicky ha sido facil y amable!
********** po

I want to thank Laura&Emiliano for their hospitality and their politeness.The position of the flat is almost perfect to discover Berlin. Next time Cafe Heaven is my first choice!
********** po

Very convenient and very quiet. You will stay among the Berliners. A bit of a walk to the Voltastr Ubahn but it is so close to the center and the big Fleamarket in Mauerpark is just around the corner. Laura and Emi were very friendly and we used to have coffee in the evenings. I will definitely stay with them on my future visit. Thank you Laura and Emi.
********** po

I've spent 2 nights at place of Laura and Emilio. They're great couple, both very friendly and helpful! The flat is clean and neat, it's on 4th floor. Although it's not mentioned, there's a kitchen that guests can use as well as heating in the room. In overall, everything was great there. I recommend it!
********** po

The room is located very conveniently - you can walk to a main part of the Berlin wall, you can find bicycle rental nearby, a metro stop is 900m away, nice small cafes. Laura is a very nice host, creating a nice and relaxed ambiance for her guests, and helping with city tips. It was a very nice experience overall!
********** po

I stayed there for 1 week and had really nice quiet time in this room, perfect for peaceful sleeps that I needed during my Berlin days. The room gets very easily warm by the heating which is totally manual to switch on or off by yourself. So I had no cold during the cold Autumn days. I liked that the room was next to the exit door, so you feel independent somehow. I only found the bathroom a bit crowded with so many things around, it can be normal since they are sharing the flat, but it would be nice to have a little corner for my stuff. The location is ok, being next to Mauerpark is really nice. The closest metro station and tram are one long street away, but you can take the bus which is right in front of the house. And yes I wouldn't suggest to new Berlin visitors to come with a big/heavy suitcase, but this is not only case of Laura's flat, buildings are high and generally there are no elevators. So don't torture yourself. For me the best part was the beautiful decoration + the green view of the room. Goodluck for your life and art Laura.
********** po

Me and my wife spent just two days in Berlin and stayed at Laura's place only for one night. That's sad because accommodation was nice and comfortable: much better than private hotels or hostels I've ever been. So, this is one more reason to stay in Berlin longer than two days (or come once again). Special thanks to Laura! With kind regards, Kate and Herman.
********** po

Laura was very nice and helpful. Her place has a very good location, quiet and pretty. We finally had an other room even better. I recommend this place!
********** po

Laura was the perfect host. I found everything as described and Laura provided me with everything I needed. The room itself is nice and has a great view. The bed is really comfortable and it is quiet. Although we were both busy doing our things we had some nice in-between-chats, so I would definitely recommend to stay with Laura!
********** po

Laura was really kind and helpful, and I had a great stay in the apartment. People around was good, and for a long stay, life was really convenient. 
********** po

the place is ok but we get a bedroom diferent from photo and we have to say that wasn't so comfortable at all. A few days before we get at her house we had a problem in our itinerary. We should have got at Poland 01/09 at 6am, visit Aushwitz during all day long and than get a bus during the night to get at her house the following morning. But unfortunately we got at Poland just at 8 pm. We sent her a message explainning our situation and we told her that probably we will get later at her house 'cause there wasn't bus to Berlin anymore. We even had made a reservation at any place and we had to pass all night long at the bus station. She wasn't comprehensive at all and almost cancelled our reservation. We felt so unconfortable with all this situation. But after we got at her house she was nice to us.

Jan was very friendly and welcoming host! The apartment was great and the area is sooo amazing, lots of nice cafes and shops! Enjoyed my time there a lot!
********** po

It is really nice area, food, park, transport are perfect! 
********** po

We had a very nice stay in Berlin, thanks to Jan's premium situated apartment. The place isn't big, but is quiet and functional, also it's situated in a perfect neighbourhood. Jan is a very welcoming host, eager to help you if needed or to provide you any kind of informations. He also has very good advice on biergarten ! 
********** po

Great location close to Mauerpark, Kastanienallee and Rosenthaler Platz, with lots of bars and restaurants nearby! Jan was very friendly and service minded. 
********** po

Apartment very well located, close to everything (supermarket, transport, city center). Very quiet nights because the apartment is located on the inside of the building. It has the basic equipment for one week stay. Jan is super accessible, nice and always available.
********** po

 My staying at Jan's was perfect: the apartment is exactly as described, is located in an amazing area, very easy to reach and close by many restaurants, bars, shops. Jan was very helpful and friendly in giving all kind of tips: how to reach the apartment, good restaurants nearby etc. Surely I would contact him again for my next stay in Berlin!
********** po

Apartment is walking distance to all the cafe's, transport, and all the main attraction. A beautiful quite place to stay in. Thank you Jan. 
********** po

Charming and quiet apartment. Excellent area, close to everything, yet quiet and cozy. Jean was very nice and gave us good recommendations.
********** po

Jan made us feel welcome in the apartment and in Berlin immediately. He gave us a guide type magazine, recommended restaurants, and told us about a website for public transport options. The apartment was clean, bright, and full of anything we needed during our stay.
********** po

The location is perfect, the apartment is very quiet and close to public transport and many restaurants. Jan was always available and quick to responding to any queries we had. We stayed 4 nights but could easily have spent longer time in this apartment. We recommend this for short or long stays for couples.
********** po

excellent stay, i would highly recommend it. a nice flat in a very nice area. Britta provided clear instructions in securing the keys, etc. Thanks again.
********** po

Britta's apartment in Berlin is in a great area. There are numerous fantastic Restaurants and Bars to suit every taste, easy access to supermarkets and public transportation. The apartment is also surprisingly large. I would surely stay there again.
********** po

Fantastic, large place in good location. Only a short tram ride to Alexanderplatz U-S Bahn, with connections across Berlin. Britta was quick to reply to all messages and gave very clear instructions regarding directions, key pick up and things to know about the place. Try Gargerin cafe around the corner for lovely and cheap continental breakfast. I definitely recommend this apartment!
********** po

We went in Berlin for the new year eve. The appartment of Britta was really amazing, very chic, cool and in a good district ! You should go there !
********** po

Location, location, location! Britta's place was just what we needed when we visited Berlin. It is in a great hip area with tons of great independent designer boutiques, lovely restaurants and art galleries. When we arrived there was even a farmer's market just steps away from her door. She gave great directions to get to her place and her business partner was happily waiting there when we arrived. He gave us great suggestions on what to do in the city and sat down with us for about an hour explaining great walks and great places to see in Berlin. Her place was clean, tidy and everything that we needed to stay there for the three nights. If we ever get a chance to go to Berlin again, we would definitely stay here again!
********** po

We were there to find out what life is like in the city so staying in someone's home was great and meant every minute added to our experience. It couldn't have been more different than a touristy hotel. Having Britta's books and pictures etc around us told us about contemporary life in prenslauer berg. The apartment is secure, comfortable and warm with lots of nice pieces of furniture and pictures. The location is ideal for shops, restaurants and interesting wandering. Also very easy to get into town. In fact we walked around a lot of Berlin from the door. 
********** po

Recommended! Nice, informative and easy to deal with. Beautiful flat in great location. 
********** po

Britta's flat is very nice and in a wonderful area of Berlin. Organisation have been precise and easy with her. Next time I'll be in Berlin I'd love to go back to her apartment.
********** po

Britta's flat was perfect for our week end in Berlin. it was nice, located in a nice area (with shops/market/restaurant/bars) and ideal to visit Berlin. I recommend it
********** po

I really enjoyed staying at this flat. It was in a great location, very charming and spacious apartment. The host arranged to have everything ready and we had no issues. I'd definitely stay there again. Thanks a lot for making our trip to Berlin enjoyable!
********** po

I've been staying at Jana's place for 2 nights. The room is fully corresponds to photos and description on the site. It was clean and bright. Jana is a very polite host. She gave me a lot of hints where to go in Berlin and what to see during my 3 days staying. Summary: very good room for its price.
********** po

Jana's room is large, bright and airy with plenty of storage for longer stays. She has full use of her kitchen - great if you plan to eat in. Her two friendly cats enjoy watching meal preparations! Jana has much literature available to plan daily excursions around Berlin. The location is ideal - just a few steps from Schoneberg retail and bars/restaurants and close to two U-Bahn stops and a major bus center. KaDeWe, Berlin's famous department store, is a short walk away. She also is a wealth of information concerning Berlin, having lived there for over 30 years.
********** po

A couple of weeks before I was meant to arrive in Berlin for work, the person who I was meant to be staying with cancelled on me and I was back to square one. However coming across Jana's profile and flat, I found exactly what I needed: somewhere close to where I would be working, a non-expensive place to stay where I could retreat to after work for a month. Jana (and her cats) was very welcoming and understanding of the situation, providing everything I needed and making my stay as comfortable and seemless as possible. Whether you are new to Berlin or not, whether you are there for a couple of days or a couple of weeks, I would recommend Jana. All the best and thanks again!

********** po

Jana was really welcoming, a nice and interesting person who has been working in art sphere. She has been living in Berlin since 1983 and gave me a great depiction of the city, shared lots of useful advice whenever I needed. The flat that she lives in is charming, old - fashioned, but absolutely in a good way. She lives with her lovely two cats - Mimi and Otelo. I stayed there for 9 nights and the general experience is great. The room is cozy, fairly clean, comfortable, spacious and airy. A wonderful collection of art books, by the way! The bathroom is clean and the kitchen has all of the genereal equipment needed if one is going to cook there. 
********** po

Jana and her guests gave me a wonderful welcome. The corner looks similar to the picture you see, spacy, a lot of light and comfortable. I had everything I needed. The location was very nice too. Close to Kurfuerstendam and other Schoeneberg area. I am just sorry that I did not have time to spend more time with the host. 
********** po

The room looks exactly like on the pictures. Big and bright. The district is OK, relatively central. 
********** po

Jana was very welcoming and showed me around the flat, explained how everything worked, the house rules, etc. She has two lovely cats, and they did not even trigger my allergies, which is remarkable. Communication with Jana was flawless, she is very reactive and helpful. The flat was as described, and the room is really big. There was a lot of place to store things (closets), and the bed was comfy. Beware though, there are no curtains, meaning it gets bright quite early. Also keep in mind the flat is on 4th floor without elevator. The area is very nice, lots of cafés/restaurants, groceries and very well connected.
********** po

Jana is absolutely lovely, and everything was great during my stay. She guided me from the airport, was always available to answers my questions, to help me planning my tour, or to talk (and play backgammon !). The place is really cosy and well located, near U7 (metro line) and Tiergarten. If you go there, you will also meet Mimi and Otello, two adorable cats, one very playful, the later one very shy but also very cuddly. I will definitely come back by her to make another tour of Berlin ! 
********** po

This is a really big room in a shared flat with Jana. Jana is very friendly and literate with an interesting career and life story. She is a great host and a good cook. The room is big enough to study or make creative projects in. The flat is near to the Nollondorfplatz Gay district and the main shopping area between Wittenbergplatz and Zoo on the U2 line which is the most useful east-west line in Berlin
********** po

I had a great stay at Jana's place. She gave me a warm welcome and set me at ease after I arrived a bit later than expected. Although I wasn't at the apartment much during the day, Jana was always easy to contact and communicate with. She also has two adorable cats. The location is fairly central with numerous buses and Wittenbergplatz nearby. Great internet connection as well. It was perfect for my week long stay! Thank you, Jana, for the book you gave me as well :-)
********** po

This is a very glamorous apartment and Steffen is a wonderful host. This is in a great location with lots to do in the area and good transport links We were very happy during our stay. This is a great deal!
********** po

The apt is wonderful. Steffen is a great host. We were very happy at his stylish loft. 
********** po

Absolutely fantastic apartment. It was clean, extremely large, and well furnished and supplied. The internet and tele both worked perfectly, the balcony was large, and I'm sure it would be nice to sit on. It rained or was terribly cold all through my trip. The apartment itself was warm with little effort though! The bathroom is large by european standards, with a great shower. Often on these websites, you see 5 minutes to transport, close to shops and nightlife and general terms. Let me be specific: You are somewhere around 4-6 minutes, depending on traffic signals, from the U1 line of the U-bahn. This line will take you anywhere, it's an excellent line to be that close to. 10 stops (15-20 minutes) is KaDeWe, 11 stops(17-22 minutes) and a 5 minute walk (if you don't get lost) is the fantastic Berlin Zoo. You can transfer lines from the U1 and get anywhere in Berlin very easily. You are three or four doors from a great turkish food place that also has all the german staples, right next to that is a fine meats house, and you are about 3 minutes from what is without question my favorite italian restaurant in Berlin. There are bakeries, both chains and small independents, in all directions. There is a bio(organic in English) market and a good sized supermarket within 3 minutes. I found a very nice park area walking down Kopernikuss Strasse, about 10 minutes away. Overall, I wanted to make it clear that this is above and beyond the average 5 star, it was clean and close to things apartment. Stay there if you're in Berlin and it's available. Kick yourself for missing it if it's not. 
********** po

A completely wonderful oasis during a brief, very busy work trip. Steffen even had a friend pick me up at Tegel to take me to the loft. As any traveler to a new city knows, this was a huge help. The loft is beautifully appointed. It is also very well connected to the rest of the city via U Bahn, S Bahn, and street cars. Friedrichshain is a fun and funky neighborhood that I really enjoyed as my temporary home in Berlin. Walk 3 minutes west to 2 banks and a Kaiser's grocery store. The kitchen has everything you need for cooking meals. Bonus - the loft is a 5 minute walk from the East Side Gallery - a long stretch of remains from the Berlin Wall that has been covered with murals by international artists. Follow the wall north to a beach bar on the Spree.
********** po

We were completely blown away upon arriving in Steffen's loft - it was so chic and modern. Steffen was very accommodating with our unusual travel schedule (arriving late in Berlin and then leaving late as well) and was there to meet us even though our flight ran about an hour late. He is very low key about the place and doesn't require a deposit, etc. The apartment itself is amazing - I don't think pictures can do it justice. It has 15-20 feet high barrel brick ceilings (it was a former old factory), four huge windows, a lovely furnished balcony, great lighting fixtures and a very modern bathroom / kitchen (with a washer and dishwasher). Although on a busy street, the apartment faces the second of two inner courtyards and is blissfully quiet. There is also great wifi in the apartment. It is located in Friedrichshain which is, as other posters have noted, a young, artsy and funky neighborhood. We found it wonderfully untouristy and the local restaurants very affordable. Steffen's place is 2 doors down from a high end organic grocery store as well and a block away from a take-out bakery and dozens of Turkish places that open all hours of the night. It is also about a 5-7 minute walk from a major train station with both U and S-bahn connections (Warschauer Strasse), making it a breeze to get to the more touristy center of town and super close to Schoenberg airport (get the Welcome Card for unlimited train rides). All in all, I'd definitely recommend Steffen's apartment for a luxurious base in a fun, non-touristy neighborhood in Berlin.
********** po

A stylish loft in the tranquil courtyard of what was an old factory. It's well appointed too, in an interesting part of inner East Berlin -- mainly dilapidated 1950s architecture, but with some lovely tree-lined streets and squares, and on the cusp of gentrification. Steffen is a very good host, and the loft is a great base for exploring Berlin. 
********** po

As other reviews suggest, this really is a lovely apartment, in a prime location to explore Berlin, with the most perfect and kind hosts. The loft is both a great place to relax or work in, and a good base to get the best out of the city and the vibrant local area. It has lots of details and touches that you wouldn't expect to find in a normal apartment, and the hosts go out of their way to make sure your arrival and departure are easy. Highly recommended.
********** po

We really enjoyed the apartment. It was well appointed, clean and a great space to chill. The location was very good; close to a good supermarket, chemist, the trams and the station. Also close to sections of the' wall' and not far from good cafes. Steffen and Andre were great and we appreciated being picked up from the airport. Would recommend this apartment to anyone.
********** po

Great apartment in a very nice location. One of our hosts even picked us up at the train station. I would definitely recommend this apartment to anyone looking to visit Berlin, and I am personally looking forward to renting it again the next time I am in the city. 
********** po

True to its pictures and posting, the Stylish East-Side Loft was impeccably clean, stylish, well-equipped and central in its proximity to transit, markets, food and shopping. From first contact, Steffen was most accommodating and our correspondence was clear & easy. As a host, he was most attentive to ensuring that my stay was a comfortable one—coming by to swap out bedding when the weather turned wintry. 

Clearly from the compilation of comments, this flat is tops. So there isn't much more color I can add to these glowing reviews, except to say : My duration in Berlin this winter was an enjoyable and inspiring experience. I have Steffen to thank for that! I hope my return in May will also be my return to Friedrichshain and the Stylish East Side Loft!

Our stay in Berlin was absolutely wonderful! The apartment was impeccable and styled very nicely- modern, done in happy colors. We felt we were able to immerse ourself in the culture of Berlin, in the hip neighborhood of Prenzlauerberg. We had a fun breakfast place down the block, and were were a very short walk from great cafes, bars and restaurants. Chris was an incredible host. We arrived late due to unexpected travel delay, and Chris met us late in the evening with a smile on his face. He had everything very organized and anticipated all of our needs. The apartment is perfect- with a kitchen, so we could save money and do a few meals at home. Sunny nice bathroom. Great windows in the bedroom. Very safe neighborhood. We were so grateful for such a wonderful place to stay and an attentive and caring host. This made our trip so memorable, and I cannot wait to go back to Berlin. The apartment has everything you need and more! Thanks Chris! 
********** po

Just spend 5 days in this lovely Berliner apartment. It's a wonderful place, hidden from the outside world with trees just outside the windows! The apartment is really cozy, quiet, with a lot of light and very clean. There also is a great bakery just outside the apartment complex, with tasty croissants and fresh eggs! We meet Chris's brother Oliver and he introduced us to the place and created a map with nice restaurants, pubs, cafes to visit in the area. We felt very welcome and nice to meet such a cool host (Good luck with (Website hidden by Airbnb) The apartment is in Prenzlauer Berg which is an excellent area, big pine lanes and everything you can wish for. for example we had the best sushi at Kopenhagener Strasse (Oliver's recommendation)and the Kopenhagener on the menu is really tasty (and great fun as we are Danish and lived in Kopenhagen - wicked!). Over and out for now. Hope to stay in you lovely place again. Then we can meet you too Chris ;) Take care and good luck you two. Greetings from Edinburgh. Maria-Louisa & Martin 
********** po

Simply perfect
********** po

We had booked Chris' apartment but the week before our arrival, he emailed to say that there was a problem with the building's heating. Just when we thought we'd have to start from square one in finding a new place, he went the extra mile in arranging our stay at his friend's apartment. He also covered the price differential between the two reservations. Really professional and quick to respond to emails-- highly recommend Chris!
********** po

Great little place and very helpful on my arrival and departure. Thanks Chris!
********** po

Lovely, charming and quiet appartment, everything I needed was there. For any additional request or question I had, the owner felt really concerned and was very responsive. Location is good, well connected to the city, and if you get a bike, even better, you're in 5 min. in Kastanian Allee, 10-15 min in Mitte (torstr. /Oranienburger Str). All comodities are around (Big shopping center in Schonhauser alle, Kaiser 5 min. walk, or minimarkts 200m away). Very positive experience, will return there when in Berlin.

Beautiful functional studio! Highly recommended.

This Apt. is in a great location in East Berlin,rith across the street from a nice park and close to restaurants and grocery stores. The owner's brother met us right on time and gave info about the area.

We have nothing but great things to say about this apartment. Firstly, it is just as the pictures show. Extremely well-maintained, bright (massive windows in the bedroom), beautiful wood floors, high ceilings, and really just all around inviting. The location of the apartment is perfect - if you're new to Berlin, this is definitely a great spot to be. Dealing with both Chris and Oliver was nothing but pleasant, plus Oliver was super helpful in answering our gazillion questions about the neighborhood. You can't ask for a better place to stay. We would choose this apartment again in a second! :)

Amazing apartment, great area, well equipped, spacious and comfortable. Great hosts, would definitely use this one again. Many thanks. 
********** po

Such a wonderful stay in Berlin, we couldn't have asked for a better location. In each direction that we traveled, there was something to enjoy. Metro/subway is close by as are great organic markets and wonderful cafes. We used Rene's apartment as home base as we ventured around Berlin for a couple of weeks. Having a reliable base was important. We wanted to see so many of Berlin's neighborhoods as the city is quite large and spread out. After walking around for most of the day, we enjoyed coming back to the apartment, picking up some necessities along the way and relaxing before we went out for the night. We stayed in the studio apartment, Studio 19, and everything that we needed was provided. Rene communicated with us very easily and our transition to Berlin proved seamless. Thanks again, we had such a great trip and we hope to return to Berlin in the future.
********** po

The apartment is wonderful! Everything is beautifully done, spotlessly clean, and it is airy and very comfortable. It is a good kitchen to cook in with everything you could need (so happy to have a toaster as that is often missing), and I felt at home there right away. It was a great place to come back to after work. Also, I would highly recommend the location: it is very near the Spree, with restaurants and very cool lounges/bars nearby but it is not too noisy on Eisenbahnstrasse on weekend nights. Lausitzer park is two blocks away and has a farmers market. Finally, Rene and Petra are extremely helpful if you have any questions. Excellent choice! 
********** po

Everything was very professional. The apartment was clean, spacious, well-located (if you want to be in the East Kreuzberg neighborhood of Berlin) and fully equipped. 
********** po

Had a great stay in this very spacious and clean apartment. One nice thing is that there is plenty of hot water. Many times, in Europe, it is limited and runs out in the middle of a shower. Petra was especially gracious upon arrival and departure. She met us at the airport upon our arrival and she quickly got us to the apartment. She also returned us to the airport. She also explained the city as we were driving to the apartment which proved very helpful. I strongly recommend availing yourself of her service.
********** po

Rene's apartment was absolutely perfect. Kreuzberg was an awesome neighborhood - full of culture, and certainly provided an authentic Berlin experience. Hope to be back soon!
********** po

Staying at Rene's place was delight. Great location and super comfortable flat! Ill recommend it to anyone.
********** po

We enjoyed our stay in Kreuzberg! The apartment is lovely with lots of light and very comfortable to stay in. The neighborhood is cool. Right across the river you have the East Side Gallery, the part of the Berlin wall with the murals painted on it. Down the street in the park on Fridays there is an organic food market, which was great. The apartment was also very close to quite a few very good restaurants. Would definitely stay here again!
********** po

I rented the apartment for my brother and his family - Rene's apartment was a perfect abode for them to base themselves in Berlin. I would whole heartedly recommend others to stay here.
********** po

the studio in berlin kreuzberg is a very nice, warm and cosy one. we all enjoyed being there :-)))
********** po

Thank you for the great room. We enjoyed the spaciousness of the room, the beautiful view over the canal and were glad to find all necessary tools to prepare a hot meal (even sugar and salt!). Price/quality is very okay. Till next time, Filipa and Wouter
********** po

Perfect location, great bars and restaurants nearby, close to main subway stops, supermarkets etc. Apartment was perfect size for us; lots of space as there is one bed up top and a convertible sofa, so as two singles it was perfect! Had everything we needed and the gentleman who welcomed us was very helpful. Made our first visit to Berlin a great experience.
********** po

My stay in Matthias' apt in Kreuzberg was wonderful. The apt is in a great location with tons of restaurants and grocery stores close by and 2 subways very near that easily connect you to the rest of Berlin. The apt itself was super comfortable and clean and gets lots of light. I would definitely stay in this apt again, and hope to. 
********** po

Matthias was a great host. My guest and I liked the apartment. I would stay there again!
********** po

Sev was very helpful. Sev showed us where to shop and the prices we could expect to pay. Offered his assistance after handing us the room key. Sev is a great guy to deal with when visiting Beijing.
********** po

We arrived in Beijing very early in the morning due to a delayed flight and Sev/East Apartments was very accommodating with helping us locate the building and getting us settled into the apartment. We were traveling in a group of 5 and found this apartment to be perfect for us- we stayed in a 3 bedroom apartment and there was plenty of space as well as a kitchen, two bathrooms and a washer (although, the washer did dye one of my white shirts a faint green). Overall, we had a great time here and would definitely recommend it to anyone traveling to Beijing. The apartments look exactly like the photos that Sev has listed. It is located Southeast of the city center and gave us a chance to explore another neighborhood. The subway line 10 Shaungjing stop is not a far walk and taxis in Beijing are very affordable. Did I mention that Sev is pretty cute?
********** po

It is a really massive apartment and really comfortable. Fully equipped for all you need in Beijing. Clean, nicely furnished and great size. Sev is an excellent host, we couldn't have survived without him,. Always there to lend his advice and help. It was so helpful! We really appreciated him. Thank you :)
********** po

Sev was incredibly helpful, showed us around the neighborhood and was available in case any questions or concerns arose. Not only that but they also offered us a tour service to the great wall which was really good! The apartment was well located with near access to the tube station (5min walk). There were lot of places to eat around too! I recommend it. :) Thanks for everything Sev. 
********** po

The appartment was ideal for our party of 6 adults; it was spacious, clean and conveniently located in an appartment complex with subway, shops, restaurants within walking distance. We were always able to contact Sev if we had any problem with our accommodation. We would recommend these serviced appartments for a stay in Beijing.
********** po

Nice place to stay when travelling in a group - metro is a five minute walk from the appartment and gets you quickly to most sites - definitively a plus considering the traffic and mostly poor availability of taxis in Beijing.
********** po

We had a great experience in Beijing. The apartment was just like the pictures. Good space for dinner with family and friends. Close to subway and shopping. Sev was very helpful during a very busy National Holiday weekend in Beijing.
********** po

The apartment was exactly what I expected (as per pictures). This is a very practical option for those travelling to Beijing. The apartment is clean, well-kept, beds are comfortable, and the service that Sev provides is excellent. Thanks Sev, for helping us around Beijing!
********** po

Definitely the place to stay when in Beijing. Apartment is spacious, clean and in a great location. Sev was very helpful and a great host. We felt right at home and very much enjoyed our stay.
********** po

We had a great time staying at Sev's appartement. The place was large and clean and close to public transportation which made the appartement an ideal base, as we went out to explore the huge city. The 24 hour key service made both checking in and out of the appartement very easy. I would recommend staying at Sev's anytime.
********** po

The apartment was very central and quite easy to find, only 5 min walk to metro, $3 cab ride to Tian Sq so we were happy. it was extremely cold in Beijing but the apartment was super warm and plenty of constant hot water. Everything was very clean neat and tidy, comfy big bid good linen etc. I was quite happy as it suited our short stay, lock up and go but to be fair to other members this is not your typical 'private ownership, AirBnB experience .. it's a kind of semi commercial set up and virtually the same as a hotel, although the aprt was about twice as big as a normal decent size hotel room., but of course with a kitchen etc. I mention this as many members are looking for a different experience with AirBnB .. and so there is none of that homely feel that you get from private landlords. I like AIrBnB to get away from the hotel environment and feel like I'm in a private non commercial set up. Only mention this for members who are looking for the same. But overall was v happy with ease of use and comfort. 
********** po

Place was as advertised and, as other reviewers have noted, it's more like long-term executive housing. Great communication from Richard and the place was safe and quiet. Close to train stop and underground malls as well as some bakeries/coffee shops. Getting to main tourist area is just a couple train stops away on line 1. The suites are located in an office-type building so if you're looking for something more quaint and residential, then you may want to look at other options. Overall, we had everything we needed for our stay and enjoyed having a home base for our exploration of Beijing.
********** po

My parents had a lovely time whilst in Beijing and Richard and his colleagues, Helen in particular were extremely helpful and accommodating. The actual flat was lovely and they were very happy with it. I would like to stay here myself when I visit Beijing in the future. Many thanks!!
********** po

Very nice apartment, clean, well equipped. Everything worked perfectly. Large living room, comfortable bed, perfect location, the subway is just a few minutes away and there are a number of restaurants and coffee places around (I particularly recommend Annie's pizzeria and a coffee place called Paris, thank you Richard for the suggestions). Helen is the nicest person, she was so helpful in every possible way. She even wrote some directions in Chinese for me so that I could ask around. Thank you so much for a wonderful stay, I'll definitely come again next time I'm in Beijing.
********** po

I had a pleasant stay in Beijing here. This is operated by a property management company and located in a high rise. The team there was extremely helpful and very friendly. The unit I had was clean and very spacious, especially for Beijing. ********** po

The room is really nice, brand new furnitures and appliances. It also have a small patio, which is a perfect place for afternoon tea or mid-night drink when the weather is not so cold.
********** po

had a great time living in this department
********** po

Decent experience. Host responded very quickly to questions. The bathroom of the unit we stayed in had some sewage smell which was unpleasant; definitely lowered the price-performance of an otherwise good experience.
********** nt

Had a wonderful holiday here.the host is kind and the house is clean and tidy with house keeping service for workday. The spot is conveniently to get CBD hot (Website hidden by Airbnb) nice experience.
********** po

This is a charming apartment with a very comfortable bed, a great shower, and best of all, a very pleasant and helpful host (Helen). The location is just about perfect with the subway nearby as are a number of good restaurants. If you get hungry for some western food, try Annies, only a couple of blocks away. Unfortunately, the building air conditioner was not working and Beijing was having a heat wave. We stayed only a couple of nights out of our planned two week stay. Helen was so understanding as was airbnb. We would definitely stay here again.
********** po

A beautiful place, rich history, and Cindy is the one and only. Lively and warm, but never overbearing. She knows everything there is to know about Beijing, and is more than helpful in pointing you in the right direction. She's also one of the funniest people I’ve been lucky enough to cross paths with. The rooms are decorated by Cindy, herself. And it shows. Each room is cozy and charming, and evokes a sense of home that is rare for me to come across in my travels. Her courtyard provides an unexpected oasis from bustling Beijing. From the minute I stepped through her front door, I wished I could extend my trip. Who can resist sitting on her swing, watching dusk settle over the courtyard; a thousand leaves rustling gently in the breeze, moon peaking crescents over sky. Or waking up to breakfast on her rooftop deck, gifting a rare view of morning sunlight painting the gently sloping rooftops of one of Beijing's few remaining hutong neighborhoods. In all my travels—from high design boutique hotels, to humble countryside dwellings—Cindy’s home easily sits within my top five. Simply put, the place has heart. 
********** po

I sort of hesitate to write this...when you find a hidden treasure you want to keep it all to yourself !!!. WOW..this was something so special and so unexpected finding this home away from home in such a perfect setting. Was like stepping back in time and leaving the hustle and bustle of Beijing behind. What a perfect place to stay and what a wonderful host Cindy makes !. As an aussie I was so surprised to find that vegemite was on the menu for breakfast ..have NEVER been to a place that took care of their guests so well. This is an area of Bejing that those poor travellers that chose to stay in impersonal hotels will never get to experience. Cindy was full on information on what to see and do but to be honest once I was sipping on an ice cold beer on the rooftop balcony enjoying the view and the wonderful company I did not want to be anywhere else. The room was so comfortable and so well decorated and yet stepping outside was like stepping back in time. This is it for me...whenever Im in Beijing THIS is the place for me...keep my room ready Cindy !
********** po

I was travelling on my own at the end of a business trip and looking for an interesting, central, safe place to stay in Beijing for a few days. Cindy's place ticked off all those boxes, but my stay there exceeded all of my expectations! Cindy and her husband went out of their way to make me feel welcome, suggesting places to go and helping to navigate Chinese menus! Chatting with them about their daily life in Beijing was fascinating - though it was not my first time to China, I felt like I left with a much better understanding of Chinese society, The hutong itself is beautifully and uniquely decorated, and the courtyard is a quiet haven from bustling, sometimes chaotic, Beijing. The room I stayed in was very spacious and comfortable, with a private bathroom and all the necessary hotel amenities (linen, shampoo, hairdryer etc.) yet felt like you were in the guest room at a friend's place! I would definitely recommend staying here :)
********** po

Courtyard B&B is a lovely, peaceful haven and a perfect escape from the noise and crowds of Beijing. The rooms are spacious, comfortable, and charmingly decorated. The location is ideal: convenient to tourist attractions and metro stations but tucked away in a traditional neighbourhood bustling with locals going about their daily activities. After a day or so, we fancied ourselves temporary Beijingers rather than tourists. Cindy and Nico are extraordinarily gracious hosts. When my partner unexpectedly missed his flight, Nico travelled all the way to the airport to find me so that I wouldn't be waiting and worried. Cindy was kind enough to purchase a fantastic cake and gorgeous flowers after my partner told her that he wanted to surprise me for my birthday. I have never before experienced hosts going so far out of their way to help two unknown guests. Cindy and Nico are very well travelled and educated and great conversationalists. I learned more about contemporary China from Cindy than from any of my books. She has worked incredibly hard to preserve and renovate her family's hutong and it was a privilege to stay in such a unique home. And the terraces are genius - not something you'll be likely to find anywhere else in Beijing! We cannot recommend Courtyard B&B highly enough - it's a very special place with incredibly helpful and generous hosts . We can't wait to be back in Beijing to see Cindy and Nico again, this time with a more relaxed schedule so that we can finally enjoy a bottle of wine together!
********** po

I first heard about Cindy a few weeks ago from a friend and her son who had just returned from a trip to China. When I mentionned that I was looking for a place to stay in Beijing while searching for more permanent accomodation, their enthusiastic praise for Cindy's courtyard made it an obvious choice for me. Besides enjoying the amazing location (just a few minutes walk from Dong Si Shitiao station), I quickly came to realize that I could not have found a better place to begin my new adventure in China's capital. Cindy and Nikos are kind and caring hosts who consistently go above and beyond their duty of care for their guests. During my stay at their courtyard I was so welcome that I came to feel almost as a part of the family. The courtyard is beautiful, but the real gem here lies with the people who live there. Besides the pleasure of getting to know Cindy and Nikos, I practiced my Mandarin with Cindy's mom while being introduced to Beijing's Farmer's Market, learnt to cook some traditional dishes with Cindy's cousin and was graciously welcomed by their neighbours. To top it all off, we worked together to host a great BBQ for a group of friends in Beijing I had met on a previous trip in 2008! I am now a permanent resident in Beijing, and my friends and family know this is the perfect place to stay whenever they come and visit me - thank you Cindy!
********** po

It is quite impossible to review Cindy and her place. We spent 8 days with them and had one of the best AirBnB experiences yet. Cindy, her mom and her husband Nikos (yeah he's Greek) exemplify what AirBnB is about. They provide a friendly, relaxed and affordable home away from home. She and her husband are available night or day for anything. At the end of our stay we were sad to say goodbye, but luckily we'll be staying with them again for a few nights in October. If you're in Beijing and the location is convenient, definitely stay with Cindy.
********** po

Cindy's place is incredible. It's a spacious and beautiful hutong, offering quite a unique place to stay on your trip to Beijing. It was easy to get to her flat from the train station and Cindy met us at the top of the metro (line 2) to bring us the rest of the way. Her location is perfect as this particular metro line hits some of the main tourist destinations in the city. Cindy was so welcoming and friendly. She made us feel right at home. That night she even hosted a traditional Beijing dinner, which we enjoyed with a few other AirBnBers who were staying there the same time as us. She also provided us with a map to navigate the city, offered some great ideas for things to see and do and made breakfast for us every morning! There are a few rooms available in the hutong, but never once did we feel imposed upon. The bathrooms and rooms are all separated and spread apart from one another. It's even more spacious than if we were to stay at a hotel and it gave us the opportunity to meet some really great people and share tips on things to do around the city. I'd highly recommend staying at Cindy's place. We couldn't have asked for a better experience and if I ever make it back to Beijing, Cindy's will be the first place I choose to stay! 
********** po

On my 4th business trip to China, I was looking for a place to stay that offered a more local experience than a typical business hotel. Cindy's guest house made all the difference. She is a warm and witty hostess who offers local insights and suggestions. The location is central and easily accessible with just a short 5 minute walk to the subway. My guest room was very comfortable with a nice bed, WiFi and good shower / toilet facilities. The courtyard is just a wonderful oasis within a busy, bustling city. I particularly enjoyed exploring the neighborhood, the beautiful courtyard plants, Bell Cat, Cindy's irreverent humor, warm smiles from Cindy's mother, visiting with other guests and early morning tea on the rooftop deck. Hats off to Cindy for this delightful gem. Can't recommend it more highly. 
********** po

Very highly recommended. It was my first trip to Beijing, and I am so grateful for Cindy and her accommodations for making it a great trip. The courtyard room is very clean and well decorated, close to the subway line and in the middle of the city.

Cindy was a great host and helped us find the restaurants, tour guides, and more. Beijing is an intimidating city, but Cindy was always there to help out.
********** po

Cindy's place was awesome! My sister and I stayed with her for 4 nights-Cindy gave us instructions in Chinese for the cab driver- and even better she was waiting for us when the cab stopped by her house!! Her place is adorable and cozy, we slept great and it was very quiet every night even though we were in one of the biggest cities in China! We enjoyed AMAZING dinners with Cindy during our stay, she took us to a couple local restaurants (within walking distance) and really gave us a great experience in China. If we ever go back, we will stay here again 100%. I highly recommend.  
********** po

The apartment is neat and clean and has everything you need to be self sustainable in Beijing. Its also in central location in Beijing, only a five minute walk to a popular subway line. Robert is very helpful and went out of his way to answer any questions i had. The apartment is basic, but i didn't go to Beijing to stay in an apartment all day. 
********** po

Robert was a great host. The apartment was easy to find and was in great condition. Robert was able to meet us earlier than we had originally planned without any problem. It was a nice stay in Beijing.
********** po

I almost don't want to send a review of this apartment because it's so great I don't want anyone else to know about it. I've been visiting China for business for the past 15 years and I think this has been the most comfortable stay I've ever had in China.  The apartment itself is comfortable, clean and has all amenities; stove & microwave oven, washer & drier. The location is even better. It is a 10-minute walk from the airport subway express & city subway lines. There are plenty of high-end and very inexpensive restaurants & also a 24-hour grocery between the apartment & subway station.
********** po

Robert and his place were both amazing. Due to the language barrier, I had trouble finding the place, so I called Robert and he came downstairs to meet me in front and helped me with my luggage up to the apartment. The apartment was exactly what I expected and looks just like it does in the photographs. The location is superb. Thank you, Robert! I hope this apartment is available for my trip next year!
********** po

Great Stay! Robert was very helpful in getting me settled in and helping me on my way after my stay. I had some rather complicated logistics getting out of Beijing and he definitely went out of his way to make sure they were taken care.
********** po

Had a good stay at Robert's studio which was nicely furnished and complete with everything I needed including a fridge and washer & dryer which I took advantage of. The apartment is very spacious with a comfortable bed and a desk that came in handy for accessing the Internet with the very fast wi-fi. The location is super convenient as it is between two subway stations and with easy connection to the airport train. Robert was particularly helpful in allowing me a late checkout. I had checked in late and was leaving two days later also late. When I asked Robert about a late check out he said he would try to arrange it and would get back to me the next morning. Well he kept his word and got back to me in the morning with a positive answer. That was awesome and demonstrated his willingness to help out. Thanks Robert!
********** po

We stayed in one of Robert's apartments for 16 days and it was a good home base for exploring Beijing. The subway is about a five minute walk (line 2 or 13) and taxi rides to the heart of the city are cheap. The apartment is showing its age, but has everything you need: fast Internet, strong hot water, good A/C, a washer and dryer, (though the drier takes a while), and a very comfy bed - a rare bonus in Asia! The building is secure, we felt safe.  Robert responded quickly to all our communications and had full bottles of water delivered for the dispenser whenever we asked. This is not a luxury apartment, but is a good value for the money. We recommend it, and Robert as a host.
********** po

Nice place and great location. It's nothing super-fancy, but is a good deal for the price. Robert is very business-like and responded very quickly to any requests I had. I did see a couple cockroaches while I was staying there, though that's been the case in plenty of places I've lived in China. 
********** nt

The apartment is as advertised and the host, Robert, was responsive and helpful. It comes with all of the basic essentials included, just bring your own bath soap. The dryer at the apartment was running, but not drying anything when I was there, but that may be fixed for future guests. The location of the apartment is excellent, basically right downtown and a short walk to a subway station. On one of the alleys that borders the apartment complex there are a number of small, local convenience type stores that have drinks, snacks, etc, and a number of street food vendors which is quite convenient. Also a short walk away you will find a full grocery store and dozens of restaurants. For those who are interested in nightlife, there is a famous bar/club district about 2 blocks away in the workers' stadium area.
********** po

Nice, clean functional apartment in Beijing. Well located with near metro with bars and eateries within walking distance. Recommended!
********** po

Pros: Clean and decent sized room for four adults. Great location for walking and subway access. Plenty of restaurants, banks, shopping, and convenience stores within walking distance. Tv with plenty of channels and free wi-fi. A/C, washer, and dryer is a nice bonus. Robert is a good host who is friendly, responsive, and offers reasonably priced tours. Cons: Shower could use a door or curtain. Would have been nice if the refrigerator worked. Beds are super firm, which I enjoyed but others did not. Summary: A good place to stay if you want to live outside of the touristy areas to experience how locals really live, yet still be close enough to visit all of the attractions in Beijing.
********** nt

Very good location! One of central underground station is just about five minutes walk. Good and friendly accommodation. Friendly and caring owner. Very comfortable beds :) 24/7 security. Good noise insulation. I suppose that this apartment is the best for visitor who doesn't want to spend much money but needs comfortable and well situated place for staying. I'm going to stay here my next time in Beijing.
********** po

The room i stayed was not the same as i booked and is depicted on the Airbnb-site. In the room there was only one bed and a sofa, which was to old and worn to be used as a bed. Furthermore, the bathroom was very dirty, hairs from previous guest were lying everywhere in the bathroom, especially under the bath mat. The kitchenett was old and dirty. Shower could use a door or curtain. WiFi was very slow (often about 2kb/s) and instable. Pros:central location in a quiet and secure area, very near to subway station
********** ng

in renting such an affordable place in a city literally half way around the world from me i had more concerns than expectations. none of my concerns were realized. i worried about smells, bad lighting, noise, scary neighborhood. the apt is clean and smelled totally neutral; the overhead lights had soft light compact fluorescents; with the patio door closed it was silent -- open, the street noises were distant; there was virtually no noise from other occupants. the neighborhood was fun, with restaurants and street activity. everything worked -- the heater, the hot water, the shower, the toilet, and the bed for westerners (from ikea). purified water was provided (a very nice touch) in a 5 gallon dispenser. the bed linens were nice. we didn't use the stove; our needs were taken care of by the electric tea kettle and microwave. The owner-robert was always rapidly responsive, whether by email or phone. We used him as our guide and driver for fours days and he did a wonderful job. This apt. is a great value, way beyond its price. i would recommend this property to anyone going to beijing for more than a night or two, and we would stay there again in a heartbeat. 
********** po

Overall a very good experience staying in the apt. Robert is easy to communicate with and picked us up at the airport. No problems and a great home base to explore Beijing from. Especially liked being so close to the subway system and to great restaurants and shops. Thanks!
********** po

The apartment was exactly what I acpected. There was anything you need:iron, waching machine, kitchen. Robert is a nice person, who came at time.
********** po

I had a wonderful stay in Beijing . Robert Sun's apartment is an excellence choice for a visit in Beijing. Just a few minutes walk to metro loop line 2 Dongsishiatao station. If you stay at any station near loop line , it is very convenience to go to any place in beijing. Dongzhimen express train station to a airport is a mere 5 minutes walk. It is also near to sunlitun...a tourist area of beijing. Yashow market in sunlitun for me is the best tourist market in beijing. Apartment also provides everything if you like to prepare you own meal. For muslim , within walking distance you can get chinese muslim restaurents. For a guide if you are a first timer in beijing, you better use Robert's transportation from airport to apartment because it may be difficult to find the place as all the signs are in chinese. I also use Robert's for my visit to great wall.The apartment is clean and Robert was very responsive to all my needs.....simply best of beijing
********** po

Overall we had a good stay in Robert's apartment. Location of the apartment is very convenient , quiet & safe. the place is an easy walk from Dongzhimen station Line 2 & 13 and also a station for Airport Express. if you use the Airport express to Dongzhimen station, once arrive, go towards Line 2 subway station then take Exit C that goes to Ginza Mall. go thru Ginza Mall and exit near the i-Space store , at the main road turn right and walk straight. the apartment block is on the left side of the road. Apartment is well kept, clean & spacious. Robert was very responsive whenever we request for anything. will stay in Robert Sun's apartment again in our next trip. 
********** po

We had a great stay in Beijing. The Apt. is perfectly adequate for 4 people. It is clean for Chinese standards and provides a good opportunity, to live inexpensive and centrally located in Beijing.

the location is wonderful! and the place is very clean and cozy. Robert has been very helpful.

Fiona is a terrific girl. Very professional, great communicator and accommodating. I was very happy to have found a place at this very convenient, clean, efficient and comfortable expat community. Will be staying here again!
********** po

Great apartment in excellent location close to shops, restaurants and subway. Apartment has amazing amounts of storage. Would definitely consider staying here again if I return to Beijing. Staff were very helpful and called for help when their English did not quite understand what I was saying. Highly recommended apartment.
********** po

Never, ever stay with Fiona. She is not actually an individual renting an apartment, but the head of a poorly managed Chinese property management company. You don't even get the room you take time selecting online, but just whatever room they have available. So that was the first lie. Had I known it was a pseudo-hotel/rental agency, I would never have booked, so I felt really manipulated and irritated. I rented a room for my boss for 3 weeks while he was in town for a business trip. The first night, she told me that they didn't have a room for him because she let other guests extend their stay, even though I had booked a reservation through Airbnb! Her response was Sorry, nothing I can do. Luckily, my boss's flight was delayed and by the second day when he arrived FIona was able to get a room for him. She never refunded us for that first night. Because she gave away the room we booked, she said she could give him a temporary apartment (an upgraded suite), but that he'd have to move in three days because we hadn't paid for a suite but a normal room. I refused, and I had to fight with her to agree not to move. She wanted to refund us for the whole stay instead and didn't understand that rebooking another place on such short notice would also have been extremely inconvenient. Lastly, my boss kept getting notices every day on his door that the electricity was unpaid and would be cut off, so I had to call Fiona multiple times to get her to pay it. WORST Airbnb experience ever. She should be banned from the site. I absolutely do not recommend that anyone ever stay with her.
********** ng

Fiona is great, and the place is just like it is in the pictures. I would highly recommend this pace.
********** po

what a wonderful place. Has all the amenities of a top class residence hotel including washing machine but for some strange reason no fridge - or hidden fridge. The location is fantastic, really convenient and even has a good swimming pool that I sadly had no time to use. I would gladly stay there again if they would accept me again :) many thanks Philippe
********** nt

The apartment is very clean and all equipments are in order including the wifi, but there is an midunderstanding about the no of guest and rooms needed. Host said it was not clearly notified by airbnb ( asked for room and not specified no of guests ) and airbnb said it was the host and i am not any wiser even now. The location is very good and got good access to subway, public buses though the front entrance is hard to find easpecially at night. Good restaurants and shops within walking distance.
********** nt

Very nice! Very good location , silent apartament, good residence. We are happy of our choice. We had washing machine, a little fridge, a very little kitchen and everything works!! Fiona si always ready to help you. 
********** po

Excellent location - walking distance to Sanlitun, restaurants, bars, and Dongzhimen subway station. Good experience over my 2 week stay and Fiona was always quick to respond to any inquiries. 
********** po

The place was fine for the money but directions to this apartment were difficult. It was fairly clean and in a huge complex of other condo's. Overall I would say a 6 out of 10.

my family had a good time in the apartment. the location is convenient, there are restaurants nearby. the room is clean and the cleaning service is good. the staff at the reception is helpful.

During April 2012 we stayed at Ray's & Florence place for 17 days to explore Beijing . Since English was a key issue – we looked for an apartment which the owner is fluent with the language. Ray and Florence were the answer to our prayers!! Ray & Florence are nice & warm persons who gave us a lot of attention and helped with all our needs. The apartment and the kitchen were very well equipped. Kitchen is well equipped with range of utensils including a fridge & stove. We've been provided with clean towels and bed linen, Rooms were cozy, with electronic A/C temperature control. There were two very nice bathrooms and constantly supply of hot water. We found that the flat was conveniently located, close to 2 subway lines and a city center, but Still in a very quiet neighborhood. Shopping for groceries was a short walk to nearby supermarket Tourist attractions about ten minutes subway drive. Staying in their flat was a wonderful experience for us! We really enjoyed the comfort and Ray’s kindness explaining everything we needed to know about the apartment. We would definitely stay at their place if we are going to Beijing in the future. Highly recommended!!! 
********** po

Myself and a friend stayed in this lovely apartment for 5 nights. Couldn't have asked for much more. Location excellent, and the apartment itself is modern and furnished beautifully. The use of the bikes made our beijing experience a richer one as well. I would absolutely recommend this place to stay to anyone!

We stayed in the apartment for 10 days in May. A family of 4. It was just GREAT! The apartment is very comfortable, modern, completely furnished and yet very homey and cozy. The location is perfect, close to the center (not a trivial thing in a city like Beijing), with all the facilities within walking distance (bars, markets, groceries, cafes, restaurants, etc.) Ray and Florence are very nice and helpful hosts. It really, really contributed to our trip being great!. Thank you. I will recommend this place anytime. 
********** po

Lovely Apartment and much nicer than the photos. Awesome views from the 14th floor and very clean and modern.  I stayed with my brother and it was so nice to have 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. I really loved the space and the location was ideal. Ray & Florence were great hosts and offered loads of help and advice. I would stay here again the next time I am in town.
********** po

Staying at Ray and Florence's place was great. Its in one of the best areas in Beijing, convenient to lots of expat amenities including bars and restaurants, but also parks and good grocery stores. We loved our stay there. We miss the urban view from the bedroom and the wonderful shower in the master bath! Ray and Florence were great hosts. They helped us get oriented with a walk around the neighborhood and helped with logistics like registering with the PSB. I will definitely check their availability the next time we're in Beijing!
********** po

My family and I stayed at Ray and Florence's apartment for 3 nights. We had a blast in Beijing and give Ray and Florence the highest recommendation! All of us agree that should we return to Beijing, we would stay at Ray and Florence's place in a heartbeat. We will be telling any friends who travel to Beijing to stay here. The apartment itself was beautifully decorated. It was clean with western style showers and very safe. The location was perfect for tourist activities, public transportation, and the expatriate area (bars, restaurants, shopping). Taxi to Tian'anmen square/Forbidden City/Wangfujing was about 20rmb or 2rmb on the subway. We even tried scorpion on a stick at Wangfujing! All in all, the apartment was much better than staying in a hotel. Ray and Florence were great hosts, helping us set up airport transfer, giving us a tour of the neighborhood, and booking a private driver to take us to the Great Wall. They gave us so many tips on where to go and what to do during our stay that we wished we would have planned more time to see the city which they both know so well. If you are touring China, stop here first, Ray and Florence are knowledgable about many other cities in China as well. If you have the chance to stay at Ray and Florence's apartment, do not pass it up - it is perfect for short or long stays. Two of us have travelled to Beijing a number of times in the past but this trip has far exceeded previous stays in Beijing. Great place and wonderful people!
********** po

The apartment was absolutely fantastic! Ray and Florence are great hosts and helped us out with a driver from the airport and to the Great Wall. The beds are comfy, kitchen has everything you need and bathrooms are super clean. I will recommend that anyone I know who goes to Beijing stays with them. It is a great base to go anywhere in the city and all necessities are nearby! Hope to stay with you again in the future!!! 
********** po

We had a wonderful time at Ray and Florence's apartment. It is well set up, very warm (we were there in the winter) and has a great view. Loved having the water cooler/heater. It's a great area to stay - because there is a substantial consulate community the locals are used to seeing foreigners. Lots of good restaurants and shops. Ray and Florence were helpful and accommodating. We felt at home while we were there and would stay again without hesitation.
********** po

A very nice appartement, well located, well equiped with all furniture very clean and good quality. Congratulations for your decoration, and with our two children we quickly feell very well as at home in this large and quiet appartement . It is surounded by all necessary super marmarkets, for foreigners or not, and not far from subway station of line 2 ( the most useful for us). The contact with Ray and Florence were always very kind and helpful by email, and their friend gives us a reliable help for Taxi. Neighboors and the day & night guard are always nice. We do hope to stay in contcat with them and have the opportunity to rent again this appartment. 
********** po

We- a family with two adult daughters- had a wonderful stay at Rays apartment. He was in the apartment when we arrived an gave us lots of useful information abut Beijing, food, restaurants and sights worth to visit. Florence showed us the surroundings. The apartment was very well equipped. We had everything what we needed. But we didnt cook there. No matter there are many restaurants nearby -worth its money. Before our visit to Beijing we had e-mail contact. There were always fast answers. We asked for a coffee machine. It was provided. Thanks a lot, Ray and Florence. Manfred 
********** po

Overall, Nathan has been really helpful throughout my stay. He helped me fixed the internet problem which I experienced during the first day and also with the taxi booking number. I would definately recommend my friends to stay there and use his service.
********** po

Nathan's apartment was very clean and it's very well located. It's about 5 minutes walking from the subway station. There is a lot of good restaurant in the neighborhood. I strongly recommend this place.
********** po

Nathan was a great host and was able to help us in a pinch when we needed a single night to stay in Beijing when others couldn't. It was a little tricky finding the place but this is only because addresses in Beijing are not easy to find. That said, the place is within easy walking distance from the last stop on the Airport Express. Would recommend again if you needed an easy and nice place to stay when quickly traveling through the city.
********** po

This was my first time to use any accommodation through Airbnb and I had a great experience. The apartment, location etc... was exactly as they said it would be, and it was all good. The thing I was most impressed with was the super friendly, honest, reliable and responsive team that managed my stay on behalf of Vera; specifically Shelia and Tracy. They were always there to help me out if I had any questions, and made my 1 month stay very easy and enjoyable. I have absolutely no complaints and only good things to say about them, the apartment and the whole experience. I have no reservations in highly recommending this mob!
********** po

Very pleasant experience... exactly as advertised and I expected. The area is also very convenient and reasonably quiet, short walking distance to Dongzhimen subway and SLT area.
********** po

Good room as in description. Efficient ans friendly service. I'd stay here again
********** po

very nice place and very friendly stuff. will come back again!
********** po

The apartment was clean, tidy, modern, didn't smell of smoke (though it is allowed) and looks exactly like the shown photos. Definitely the place I was looking for. The place is tricky to find, but the location 8 - 10 minutes from the Dongzhimen subway station along a quiet street made our stay very pleasant. From here you can reach many of the interesting spots in Beijing in a reasonable time and we definitely couldn't ask for more. Unfortunately we didn't hear anything for a long time after our booking was confirmed by the Vera (or Vera's staff) and we only got informed about the address and how to deal with picking up and dropping off the keys to the building two nights before our arrival after several airbnb messages, a text message to her mobile and last but not least a phone call to china. We hope this was the exception to the rule. But as soon as we arrived, the staff around Vera was very helpful and kind. In the apartment you will also possibly find the brochure for different tours to the great wall and a few other stops, presented on the book shelve. The staff arranged the booking and did a great job to help us. The tour on the other hand was quite a disappointment and I don't recommend to book the tour passing the jade and silk museums and an unscheduled visit to a tea ceremony as all these places consist of 10% guided tour space through the museum and 90% shopping space, what a waste of time, no kidding. Plus the extra 130 RMB we were confronted with in the tour bus to pay the chairlift to actually reach the wall in a reasonable time instead of hiking for 45 minutes as time was rather limited at the wall. So I guess you understand where this is going, apartment great, location great, staff great (if you can reach them), tour terrible.
********** nt

Great place in convenient location.
********** po

Vera is kind and the experience is excellent.
********** po

My friends and I stayed in Betty's apartment for a week and couldn't have been more comfortable. The two bedrooms were large and easily slept the four of us. Everything about the apartment was great - having wifi, local phone, living room, and kitchen were all really helpful. The location is pretty ideal - right between two subway stops. Betty was a great host, making sure we were comfortable and getting us set up with the right documentation with the local authorities. I highly recommend staying with her.
********** po

We really enjoyed Betty's apartment. She threw in free cleaning and was on top of taking care of all of our needs. Her English is impeccable as she lived in the US for 20+ years, so for anyone nervous about not being able to communicate in China she may be a great option. Thanks Betty!
********** po

The apartement was very nice, central and convinient. Betty and her helpers were eager to help. It did take some time to register at the police station, but that is what happens when you stay at an apartement instead of a hotel. We would defenitly come again.
********** po

We are an American family of five (2 adults, 2 kids, 1 baby) and the apartment was just perfect for our week-long stay in Beijing. The location is very central, within walking distance (circa 15 mins) of Tian'an Men Square and Forbidden City. While we absolutely loved living on a hutong, it was also very helpful to have some large hotels (Hyatt, Regent) nearby when we had trouble communicating with cabbies, etc. The apartment itself was clean, spacious, comfortable and quiet. We all slept very well. (Don't expect 5-star ammenities, but rather tasteful Ikea, which was perfectly fine by us.) The owner, Betty, was extremely professional and easy to deal with. We had a wonderful stay and would highly recommend Betty's apartment to any family or group wanting to get a taste of real Beijing.
********** po

We stayed for 6 days in this lovely apartment with our baby daughter and it was perfect for our holiday. Spacious, comfortable and warm (it had just snowed in Beijing before we arrived so we were grateful for the central heating!). Betty has provided all the facilities you would need. The apartment is set within a quiet garden courtyard, but is 2 minutes walk from lots of shops and restaurants. And is conveniently located for the metro as well. Would highly recommend.
********** po

Great location. Clean, spacious flat. Would recommend to anyone.
********** po

Big apartment, well equipped. Very good service, excellent location. Recommended.
********** po

The Check in was fast and flexible. The price is fair, because the flat ist big enough for 8 people if you are flexible as well. We were the in a time where it wasn't so hot outside, so I have no idea how hot it can get inside. This was my second Airbnb stay so I can't compare it so good with other apartments but I would wish me, that the owner, offers the guests more toilet paper etc. . Because if it is a short stay, you don't want to buy all the staff in big packages. All in all we are very happy with this decision 
********** po

Great location and enough space in the apartment for 7 people. Although the mattresses were a bit too soft and the house is quite noisy, its a solid choice for a big group of people for a weekend in barcelona.
********** nt

Our experience here was mixed. The location of this flat is super close to La Sagrada Familia, and there are lots of cute restaurants and cafes nearby. The flat itself wad impersonal and not well represented by the photos. The folks who rent this spot have a bunch of other places in the city. So even though it was spacious, it lacked charm, and was heavily used without being heavily cleaned. There were extra pillows, but no extra pillow cases; the one spare blanket was covered in unwashed food stains (as was the furniture); and while the large bed was comfy, the small bed I slept in felt like laying on a box filled with metal springs. I have an Airbnb if my own, and work very hard to accurately represent my space. It was disappointing not to find that to be the case here. That said, check-in was easy, and when we had trouble with the heater, the response was quick.
********** ng

Super fast and easy check-in and very friendly service. The price is fair and the apartment has enough space for 7 people. The locations of this flat is amazing. There are lots of cute restaurants, cafes and supermarkets nearby. More or less 3min walking distance to la Sagrada Familia, few bus stops and a metro station close by. During our stay it wasn't so hot outside so we needed to turn on the heater. It takes a while until it warms up the flat so you may can feel cold as we did.
********** nt

Amazing flat at a great location in Central Barcelona. Will definitely recommend.
********** po

Nice place very big
********** po

Great location and nice apartment.
********** po

Great Location with a lovely morning view of the Segrada FamÃ­lia. Anna from Barcelona4seasons was punctual and exceptionally helpful in advising on the best way to spend our time in Barcelona. The apartment was clean, slightly quirky and had everything we needed. The building itself could do with a facelift and the lift is a little tight but all in all a very comfortable stay.
********** po

Even though the hosts were not there at the moment, the mother of Meritxell welcomed us warmly and showed us around this spacious apartment. Everything was as described, tidy, sunny and clean, with a really nice interior. The balcony is simply awesome. The location is perfect as it's private and tranquil, but also modern and central, close to everything you need. Thank you, Meritxell. 
********** po

We had a great experience in Meritxell's apartment. Her mother was really nice and showed us around. Comfortable bathroom and a small cozy bacony in which you can smoke. The room itself was very clean, they even had an extra map and some city guides lying around for us. The apartment is really bright and shiny. 1 minute walk from the Tram which was most useful for us because of the Primavera Sound Festival. Nothing negative to say, overall :) Would definitely recommend.
********** po

We had an amazing weekend in Meritxell's flat ! The flat is perfect. You can find anything you need nearby (subway, streetcar, restaurant, supermarket...) and it's near the beach and Sagrada Familia. I recommend ! 
********** po

Nice appartment and it was easy to move anywhere by metro or bus
********** po

We were in Barcelona for two nights and had a nice stay at Meritxell 's apartment. It is easy to reach the city by tram or metro and the room was good for two people. She was very helpful and nice and we would recommend this apartment to others.
********** po

She was really friendly + free area's were very kind. The neighborhoof was good and close to everything
********** po

Very cozy flat with best location! And host was nice and ready for help. I like cats and it was really nice that she likes them too, so pillows and other stuff in living room represent some cats subject).
********** po

Nice apartment with good metro connection. Meritxell was a nice host and was flexible regarding arrival and departure time. Due to not having air-condition in the room, it was pretty hot even during night in the room.
********** nt

We had great 9 nights! Room was nice and very clean, rest of the apartment also. Big double bed. Meritxell and Ignasi were very nice to us. We had nice breakfasts on the balcony every morning. It's 15' to the beach which is close. Neighborhood is nice and there is supermarket nearby. Highly recommend!
********** po

Meritxell and her husband were absolutely wonderful. They made us comfortable and very patient considering we were traveling with a small baby. The place was close to the beach and were extremely hospitably. Most importantly non intrusive
********** po

We (5 friends) were staying for a conference in the nearby center and were pleasantly surprised. The apartment was clean, quiet, modern and spacious. It had extensive commodities like laundry machines, fast internet, dish washer and a nice balcony. I would definitely recommend it!
********** po

We had a nice stay at the apartment. It is a 10 min walk to the beach and a 5 minute walk to a huge shopping center. The apartment is spacious and has a well equipped kitchen. We would stay there again.
********** po

Great apartment! It was plenty spacious for us, and the balcony is just great. Tony was super helpful getting me oriented and giving us tips for our stay. We were going to a conference at CCIB, which is just down the street. Getting into the center was also very easy since we had a tram stop right in front of the building and a metro stop a short walk away. We would definitely stay there again in a heartbeat!
********** po

I stayed in Marnie's apartment with two colleagues while attending a conference at the CCIB Centre in Barcelona. The apartment is lovely and very convenient to the Convention Centre. It's also a short walk to a shopping centre that has a supermarket. The apartment was very clean and well appointed. We felt very at home and there were even some Spanish beers left for us in the fridge. I would be very pleased to stay again.
********** po

The apartment was great! Convenient location, really clean, and there was even a bottle of wine waiting for us!
********** po

Great apartment, wounderful host and nice safe area. A bit further outside city center than we thought but easy to catch tram or metro. We might come again 
********** po

The apartment was absolutely beautiful! Perfect for our family. It was close to the metro and an easy walk to Diagonal Mar mall and lots of restaurants. Communication with our host was very helpful before and during our stay. We highly recommend this apartment for an awesome stay in Barcelona!
********** po

Fantastic experience! Very easy to get to! Very close to the L4 Metro from FÃ³rum to get into the city. Get the T-10 ticket if you plan to take the metro more than a few times. The apartments was fantastic! I was in town for 2 weeks and did a load of laundry and having a dryer was a rarity in the area. Everyone was friendly and welcoming. The entire experience was 5-stars!
********** po

Good place, Excellent host. I'll book it again next time I'll go to Barcelona
********** po

Great apartment, very clean and lots of space.

Pedro is an intelligent, sensitive and kind young catalan. A cool cat, one might say. He reached out to us when we were really in a bind and invited us into his home despite the last minute request and the late hour. His apartment is clean, warm and friendly with a state of the art bathroom facility. Great guy that I highly recommend! 
********** po

I had a REALLY GREAT time with Pedro! He is extremely nice and his apartment is beautiful. I had a very comfortable room for myself, and Pedro generously let me use his kitchen. The location is just perfect - it is in the very central location and very close to 3 subway stations. I absolutely loved my stay in Barcelona. I would definitely recommend staying with Pedro!
********** po

Pedro's place is very comfortable and has all the essentials you need to travel. He made sure we were comfortable and the location is convenient for the metro and is very active. It is close to many restaurants and internet cafes and is within walking distance to the major Barcelona attractions. Given all the wonderful activities within the area the noise level was a bit much for the light sleeper but we would highly recommned this place.
********** po

Pedro was very welcoming and nice, his flat is sunny and wonderfully situated, I strongly recommend him !
********** po

Friendly and inviting home. Conveniently located to the 5th Avenue shops and metro. I will definitely stay at Pedro's house again as he is a wonderful host.
********** po

Pedro was very nice and friendly. He has exceptional music taste. Location is perfect. Very comfortable room. I highly recommend Pedro's place.
********** po

Pedro is great host, provided us with all required things. Apartment location is perfect. Recommended!
********** po


Pedro is a warm host and interesting to talk to. He is very flexible with the arrangements. There are some bars right below but I think the noise is not any worse than most places in Barcelona. The area has lots of nice shops and restaurants and it is also convenient to the central tourist spots. 
********** po

pedro was a great host. i really enjoyed the stay with him.
********** po

My heart remains in Barcelona! Pedro I miss you))
********** po

Our host made us to feel welcome and the room was nice, clean and had also a bathroom, which made us feel independed from the rest of the house. Some problems we had with the room were solved quickly, as well. However, in the morning, when we had to leave, the host came into the room, while we were sleeping and told us to hurry up. We could understand that another costumer would come, but it wasnt the best way to say it. Despite that, the host was friendly and the room in a nice neighbourhood.
********** nt

Very nice and clean flat, well located and easly connected to the metro. We enjoyed staying there. Thanks! I do recommend it to anyone visiting Barcelona and who like to explore the city, St Paul Hospital, Sagrada familia..

Alex is an amazing person and host.WE had amazing stay at his place.His rooms is fairly large has private bathroom and toilet and room has AC which is amazing.Clean and comfortable bed and room. Thank you.
********** po

The hosts were very nice. They were responsive to all emails. Location to Sagrada Familia was very good. So was the design and condition of the room. Beds were comfortable. Beware there is no elevator in the building. We liked the room. The one exception was the shower. It did not work well at all. No pressure whatsoever. Really something that is important.
********** nt

Nice, clean room. It has everything you need. Good location (walking distance from Sagrada Familia and metrostop 'Alfonso X' ) It's nice the aria is a little less 'busy' . Good (value for money) restaurants/bars nearby. Alex is very friendly and it's very easy to communicate with him (quick respons to mail and sms) . We had a Nice stay! 
********** po

This was our first time using Airbnb and the living situation was as expected and described on the posting except: 
The shower only sustains hot water long enough for about a 3-4 minute shower. This was an annoyance as there were 3 of us who had long hair requiring more rinsing and washing. There was also an additional resident staying in a room adjacent to ours. He spoke no Spanish or English and only Russian, making communication impossible. We saw him only a couple of times and we were not able to recognize him when banging on the door to let him back in. The last night of our stay he got locked out of the apartment and came home at approximately 1:30 am and woke us to open the door. The host Alex was gracious enough to take phone calls and come to resolve the situation at that late hour but on the eve of a 7am flight the next morning this presented a significant issue. That being said our stay was relatively pleasant and we were able to enjoy the city for the most part. The beds were comfortable and the places to see were very close to the apartment. Alex was very nice and accommodating the entire trip.

The appartment was very clean, calm and good location!!! Very recommended.

We had a wonderful tim in Barcelona and the appartment was great! Excellent view from the private roof terrase, easy access to metro, close to shops, farmacy and hospital. The host was very friendly and easy to communicate with. Highly recommended for anyone travelling to Barcelona.

Lina was a great host, very friendly and easy to communicate with as well. When we arrived she showed us everything we needed to know, as this was my and my friends first time in Barcelona. The apartment itself was really great as well! Beautiful view from the big terrace all over the city, ac and very fresh overall. The neighborhood was perfect for us, with mostly locals and a sweet bohemian feeling over it but still very close to the subway. I would definitely recommend Linas place for your stay in beautiful Barcelona!
********** po

Great apartment, great location, AMAZING view. Cannot say enough good things about staying at this place. Had everything we needed and more. Close to lots of the sites, bars, cafes, grocery stores etc. 
********** po

My girlfriend and I stayed here for three days, and we couldn't have asked for a better place. Lina is very professional and easy to work with. I recommend this apartment. 
********** po

A gorgeous place to stay. Every morning we had breakfast in the sun and enjoyed the great view. The apartment was neat and clean, everything we needed was available. Metro Joanic is nearby and Parc Guell: it's just around the corner! We learned to love Barcelona, thanks to the great information Lina gave us.
********** po

Lina's gaudi penthouse was amazing. The house is a great size and has a lot of natural light which I really enjoyed. The shower and bathroom were perfect and there was plenty of storage for clothes available. The view from the balcony is beyond amazing and the district where this house is located is hip, safe, and clean. Lina was very helpful in recommending places to visit and helping me understand the laundry machine :) I would stay here again!
********** po

Just amazing!!! The apartment was perfect and had everything we ever needed, and more. Lovely terrace! So easy and simple, highly recommend this place and Lina! I am never going to check in to an hotel ever again =)
********** po

Great appartment, great terrace. During night and day it is really quiet there - good for relaxing after a great day in the busy city! Not far from the beautiful places in Gracia. We can highly recommend this appartment!
********** po

My stay in Barcelona was amazing. The gaudi 2 flat is beautiful and clean with lots of space. I loved the patio, it is perfect for dinner or relaxing with a glass of wine. If you want to be in the middle of the action this is not the place for you. It is a great eclectic neighborhood for someone who is independent and likes to (Website hidden by Airbnb) about a 15 min metro ride to las Ramblas or barcelonetta area. Would totally stay here again.

Perfect experience!
********** po

Very nice department with a lovely terrace on the top of the building. It was aircondition in two roomes but not in the third one. We had it comfortable there, but it would have been better if the metro would have been closer. But anyway it was not so far to the metro and it was easy to get a taxi almost just outside the door. The neighbourhood was also nice and with a litle walk down the street it was alot of small shops. The host was very nice and polite.
********** po

The apartment was very well equipped, the view was spectacular and Lina was a good host. We loved our stay!
********** po

very clean and big flat with two awesome patios, one of them with a beautiful view over the city. the only little problem we had was that one of the bedrooms was way too small, more like a students dorm. perfect for a child, but a little too small for a grownup to sleep in. all told i can totally recommend this appartement!

The place was awesome, great host not far from the beach really, really great spot.

We are family of 5 who stayed with Fergus for a 3 night City break between our 2 week holiday in Spain. We were greeted to very warm welcome by Fergus and he remained very friendly and helpful throughout our stay. The newly renovated apartment was 5 star quality and spotlessly clean and in a prime location in heart of las rambles. This apartment would suit anyone who wants to have a ture Barcelona Experience.
********** po

Fergus is a wonderful host, very helpful, very quickly answers all the questions. The apartment is really stylish and comfortable with everything you might need during a visit in Barcelona. What's more, the owner gave us really useful advise about the parking, restaurants in the city etc. I totally recommend the place.
********** po

Fergus place is as nice as it looks on the pictures. It is very clean and fresh and has all of the things you could ask for. Comfortable beds and great air conditioning. You will also have a fully equipped kitchen, washing machine and dryer. I fully recommend this place as for the location which is right in the middle of ramblas, the apartment itself and the host Fergus. He is very helpful and super nice and easy to reach, he will answer and help you with anything you need super fast! The apartment is also super secure. You wont be dissapointed!
********** po

Fergus's appartment was very clean, cozy and the location was just outstanding. He welcomed us very warmly and continued to help us with all small things during our stay. Thanks a lot for your hospitality and desire to help us with anything we could just imagine!
********** po

The apartment was beautiful and in the heart of las ramblas and you can get almost anywhere through walking or public transportation. The apartment was also very secured and we always felt safe. Ferg was very accommodating and always made sure that we had everything we needed and were comfortable. Would highly recommend to everyone!
********** po

Ferg was a really nice host, very welcoming and always there if you needed anything! He gave us a lot of helpful tips where to go and if we got lost in the city he would answer very quickly. The apartment has the perfect location because itâ€™s in the central and you have shops next to you and the beach is also not too far away. Itâ€™s also decorated very pretty and there are two TVs! We loved our stay and would always do it again.. thanks to Ferg we had a wonderful vacation :)
********** po

Excellent place. Host was very friendly and offered some advice on places to go locally.
********** po

Fergâ€™s place was awesome! We needed a place to stay last minute, found Fergâ€™s place & booked it. Ferg met us upon arrival, got us up to his apartment, welcomed us with a bottle of wine, some fresh flowers to brighten up the kitchen & gave us the run down of everything from the apartment to the area, Las Rambla. Fergâ€™s place was immaculate, the beds are very comfortable, he was very welcoming & made us feel very comfortable while staying there. I highly recommend staying (Website hidden by Airbnb) of the best hosts Iâ€™ve ever interacted with & his place is awesome!!!
********** po

Ferg is great! The apartment was wonderful for our family! Couldnâ€™t ask for a better host or apartment.
********** po

Really nice apartment with good viewing rooms. If youâ€™re going with your close friends or family, highly recommend this bnb. The location is excellent with everything approachable.
********** po

Great place with excellent location. Able to walk anywhere from accommodation. Host helpful supplying detailed instructions for nearby car parking and quick to answer any queries. Nice touches of supplying towels and bottled water. Great place, would use again.
********** po

Even though we arrived super late (around midnight) the check-in was smooth. Kateâ€™s boyfriend opened up immediately and showed us the apartment. Communication via Airbnb was great generally - reliable and fast response time. The location of the apartment is awesome and everything is as shown on the pictures.
********** po

The location was great and the communication and check in with Kate was easy and without any problems. We had enough space for 4 people and would stay there again.

It is very nice place to stay
